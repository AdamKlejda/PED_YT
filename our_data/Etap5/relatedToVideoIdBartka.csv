I'm using this platform to generate money to fund the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. I truly believe the best way to promote the advancement and protection of Black people in America is to educate ourselves in every way possible and arm ourselves with education and the information needed to resist and eradicate our oppressors from positions of power. If you feel the same way or simply want to help our cause, please donate whatever you can and take this video as a gift from me to you. Thank You! Your friend KYLE :)

Lyrics: 
Yes, shawty knows she fuckin’ with the best
Logo shit, I feel like Jerry West
She gon’ blow this whistle like a ref

Yes, I got plenty tattoos on my flesh
Drip on me, I tactical my vest
Hunnids everywhere, I made a mess
 
Yes, I keep racks on me, no, I ain’t stressed
A hundred for a show, don’t do no less
Pull up on the jet, now she impressed

Damn, yeah
Shawty knows she fuckin’ with the man
Yeah, she callin’ me like she ain’t got no friends
Yo, they sleep on me, they off too many Xans 
Skrrt, skrrt (wake up, nigga, damn)
 
Damn, yesterday the Bentley truck, today the Lamb
I done fucked and blocked a bitch like she was spam
I done took my bitch to Bali for a tan
Bitch, I’m rich, I’m walkin’ ‘round with lot of bands
 
Get money all day
Even on my off day
Yo’ girl in good hands
My crib like Allstate

Dem boys on child’s play
I’m who you call bae
Came to get lit, hoe 
Treat Monday like a Friday
 
Yes, shawty knows she fuckin’ with the best
Logo shit, I feel like Jerry West
She gon’ blow this whistle like a ref
 
Yes, I got plenty tattoos on my flesh
Drip on me, I tactical my vest
Hunnids everywhere, I made a mess
 
My money blue
No cappin’ in my rappin’, this shit true
You hating on a nigga, that ain’t cool
Yo, I hit it from the back, I make that bitch say ooh

I’m so entertainin’
Yo bitch wanna date me
Got so many hoes, I’m surprised I don’t have a baby

Shawty think I’m wavy
I’m like fuck you, pay me
If you talkin’ racks, you know I get that on the daily

They be talking crazy 
Niggas think they Jay-Z
Swear they bitch Beyoncé, but she look like my auntie
Why these niggas cappin’? 
I don’t know, that shit beyond me

All this fuckin’ jewelry on, it ain’t hard to find me
 
Yes, shawty knows she fuckin’ with the best
Logo shit, I feel like Jerry West
She gon’ blow this whistle like a ref
 
Yes, I got plenty tattoos on my flesh
Drip on me, I tactical my vest
Hunnids everywhere, I made a mess
 
Look
Down, down, baby
Oh, she goin’ crazy
Sweet, sweet baby 
Damn, she never let me go

Down, down, baby 
Oh, these bitches shady
Boom, boom, baby
You just like every hoe
 
¿Cómo estás boy

-- | LYRICS |--

The club isn’t the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go 
Me and my friends at the table doing shots drinking fast and then we talk slow
you come over and start up a conversation with just me and trust me I’ll give it a chance now
Take my hand stop, put van the man on the jukebox and then we start to dance
And now I’m singing like

Girl you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now follow my lead
I may be crazy don’t mind me 
Say boy let’s not talk too much 
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now follow my lead
Come come on now follow my lead

I’m in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I’m in love with your body
Last night you were in my room 
And now my bed sheets smell like you 
Every day discovering something brand new
I’m in love with your body

Oh I X 4
I’m in love with your body
Oh I X 4
I’m in love with your body
Oh I X 4
I’m in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I’m in love with the shape of you 

One week in we let the story begin
We’re going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty
So go all you can eat 
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family’s doing ok
leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play
and I'm singing like

Girl you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now follow my lead 
I may be crazy, don’t mind me
Say boy let’s not talk too much 
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now follow my lead
Come come on now follow my lead

I’m in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I’m in love with your body
Last night you were in my room 
And now my bed sheets smell like you 
Every day discovering something brand new

Well I’m in love with your body
Oh I x 4 
I’m in love with your body
Oh I x 4
I’m in love with your body
Oh I X 4
I’m in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I’m in love with the shape of you 

Come on be my baby come on X 8

I’m in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I’m in love with your body
Last night you were in my room 
And now my bed sheets smell like you 
Every day discovering something brand new

Well I’m in love with your body
Come on be my baby come on X 6
Every day discovering something brand new
I’m in love with the shape of you

Lyrics:
Baby, lay on back and relax
Kick your pretty feet up on my dash
No need to go nowhere fast
Let’s enjoy right here, where we at

Who knows where this road is supposed to lead
We got nothin’ but time
As long as you right here next time
Everything’s gonna be alright

If it’s meant to be, it’ll be, it’ll be
Baby just let it be
If it’s meant to be, it’ll be, it’ll be
Baby just let it be

So won't you ride with me, ride with me
See where this thing goes
If it’s meant to be, it’ll be, it’ll be
Baby if it’s meant to be

I don’t need to be so uptight
But my heart’s been hurt a couple times
By a couple guys that didn’t treat me right
I ain’t gonna lie, I ain’t gonna lie

‘Cause I’m tired of the fake love
Show me what you’re made of
Boy, make me believe

Whoa hold up, girl, don’t you know you’re beautiful
And it’s easy to see

If it’s meant to be, it’ll be, it’ll be
Baby just let it be
If it’s meant to be, it’ll be, it’ll be
Baby just let it be

So won't you ride with me, ride with me
See where this thing goes
If it’s meant to be, it’ll be, it’ll be
Baby if it’s meant to be

So come on ride with me, ride with me,
See where this thing goes
So come on ride with me, ride with me,
Maybe if it’s meant to be

Maybe we do, maybe we don’t
Maybe we will, maybe we won’t

But if it’s meant to be, it’ll be, it’ll be
Baby just let it be
If it’s meant to be, it’ll be, it’ll be
Baby just let it be

So won't you ride with me, ride with me
See where this thing goes
If it’s meant to be, it’ll be, it’ll be
Baby if it’s meant to be

If it’s meant to be, it’ll be, it’ll be
Baby if it’s meant to be
If it’s meant to be, it’ll be, it’ll be
Baby if it’s meant to be

rTENOP3tbjU,,Timebelle -  Apollo (offizieller Videoclip official),Timebelle Official,,2017-11-10T04:34:48Z,,,,,,,,,,"With the power ballad «Apollo», Timebelle is representing Switzerland at the Eurovision Song Contest 2017 in Kiev, Ukraine. The band is named after the famous Swiss landmark «Zytglogge» in Berne. However, Timebelle is also a tribute to a «beautiful time» in Berne, where the band has been formed.
As the perfect trio, the three band members will be performing from the heart of Kiev:
 
As a trained musician and dedicated actress, lead singer Miruna Manescu from Romania will be expressing her passion for art. The most important thing for her is to be happy and to have a peaceful mind. Music has a great influence on her and helps her to enjoy life.
 
Samuel Forster is drummer and lives in Eastern Switzerland. He teaches drums and percussion. He tries to pursue his professional visions with boundless energy and a talent for organization.
 
Emanuel Daniel Andriescu plays the piano, but also teaches saxophone and clarinet. The internationally active musician has been living in Switzerland for ten years. He achieves his goals with a lot of charm.
 
With the song «Apollo» and its distinctive melody, the three creative souls express their hopes and dreams while asking themselves whether there is such a thing as eternal youth.

Apollo (lyrics)

Like a bullet in my chest 
You're written, bound and etched 
Forever in my mind
 
We are fading in our hands
Lost somewhere in wasteland
Not knowing up from down
 
But when the walls are caving in
The world keeps turning
We got the love
We got to love

No I will never let you go
All the walls won't make me fold
It is never easy
I follow you Apollo
No I will never let you go 
Give it time and we will grow 
Ain't no fun in easy
I follow you Apollo
I follow you Apollo

I wear my heart on my sleeve
You do the same for me 
When autumn comes around
  
So when the walls are caving in 
The world keeps turning 
We got the love
We got to love 

No I will never let you go
All the walls won't make me fold
It is never easy
I follow you Apollo
No I will never let you go 
Give it time and we will grow 
Ain't no fun in easy
I follow you Apollo
I follow you

So don't pull the rug from underneath us 
We're in trouble but we got the love 
Don't pull the rug from underneath us 
Crashing down fast, as fragile as glass 
But what are we now 
If we never tried? 
What are we now?

I will never let you go
Give it time and we will grow
It is not supposed to be easy

No I will never let you go
Give it time and we will grow
Ain't no fun in easy
I follow you Apollo
I follow you Apollo
You Apollo
It is never easy
I follow you Apollo
I follow you Apollo
You Apollo
Ain't no fun in easy 
I follow you Apollo
I follow you Apollo

About Anne-Marie:
Anne-Marie has proved to be one of the UK’s most exciting and successful British breakthrough popstars of recent years.

LYRICS:
I know you moved onto someone new
Hope life is beautiful
You were the light for me to find my truth
I just wanna say, thank you

Leaving to find my soul
Told her I had to go
And I know it ain't pretty
When our hearts get broke
Too young to feel this old
Watching us both turn cold
Oh, I know it ain't pretty
When two hearts get broke
Yeah, I know it ain't pretty
When two hearts get broke

I hope someday
We'll sit down together
And laugh with each other
About these days, these days
All our troubles
We'll lay to rest
And we'll wish we could come back to these days
These days
These days, these days
These days, these days
 
Three years of ups and downs
Nothing to show for it now
And I know it ain't pretty when the fire burns out
Calling me when I'm drunk remind me of what I've done
And I know it ain't pretty when you're trying to move on, yeah

I hope someday
We'll sit down together
And laugh with each other
About these days, these days
All our troubles
We'll lay to rest
And we'll wish we could come back to these days, these days

Oh I know, I know
Oh I know, I know
Oh I know, I know
These days, these days
Oh I know, I know
Oh I know, I know
Oh I know, I know
To these days, these days
 
Cigarettes in the ashtray
Reminiscing on those past days
I thought you’d end up with my last name
But that changed
And I travelled around the world
Think where you living at now?
I heard you moved to Austin
Got an apartment and settled down
And every once in a while
I start texting
Write a paragraph
But then I delete the message
Think 'bout you like a past time
I could cry you a river
Get you baptised or
I wasn't ready to act right
Used to always think I'd get you back, right
They say that things fall apart
We were gonna move to Brooklyn
You were gonna study Art
Love is just a tool
To remind us who we are
And that we are not alone
And we're walking in the dark
 
I hope someday
We'll sit down together
And laugh with each other
About these days, these days
All our troubles
We'll lay to rest
And we'll wish we could come back to these days, these days
We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days",Il-an3K9pjg

Lyrics:
Everything's been so messed up here lately
Pretty sure he don't wanna be my baby
Oh, he don't love me, he don't love me
He don't love me, he don't love me, but that's okay
'Cause I love me, yeah, I love me
Yeah, I love me, yeah, I love myself anyway, hey

Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be okay
It's gonna be a good, good life
That's what my therapists say
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be just fine
It's gonna be a good, good life

I'm a mess, I'm a loser
I'm a hater, I'm a user
I'm a mess for your love, it ain't new
I'm obsessed, I'm embarrassed
I don't trust no one around us
I'm a mess for your love, it ain't new

Nobody shows up unless I'm paying
Have a drink on me, cheers to the failing
Oh, he don't love me, he don't love me
He don't love me, he don't love me, but that's okay
'Cause I love me, yeah, I love me
Yeah, I love me, yeah, I love myself anyway, hey

Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be okay
It's gonna be a good, good life
That's what my therapists say
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be just fine
It's gonna be a good, good life

I'm a mess, I'm a loser
I'm a hater, I'm a user
I'm a mess for your love, it ain't new
I'm obsessed, I'm embarrassed
I don't trust no one around us
I'm a mess for your love, it ain't new

Everything's gonna be alright, alright
Everything's gonna be just fine, just fine
It's gonna be a good, good life

I'm a mess, I'm a loser
I'm a hater, I'm a user
I'm a mess for your love, it ain't new
I'm obsessed (I'm obsessed), I'm embarrassed
I don't trust no one around us

I eat my dinner in my bathtub
Then I go to sex clubs
Watching freaky people getting it on
It doesn't make me nervous
If anything I'm restless
Yeah I've been around and I've seen it all

I get home, I got the munchies
Binge on all my Twinkies
Throw up in the tub, then I go to sleep
And I drank up all my money
Days kind of lonely

You're gone and I got to stay high
All the time to keep you off my mind, ooh ooh
High all the time to keep you off my mind, ooh ooh
Spend my days locked in a haze
Trying to forget you babe, I fall back down
Gotta stay high all my life to forget I'm missing you

Pick up daddies at the playground
How I spend my day time
Loosen up the frown, make them feel alive
I make it fast and greasy
I know my way too easy

You're gone and I got to stay high
All the time to keep you off my mind, ooh ooh
High all the time to keep you off my mind, ooh ooh
Spend my days locked in a haze,
Tryin' to forget you babe, I fall back down
Got to stay high all my life to forget I'm missing you

Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end
Oh, can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain
Oh, staying in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end
Oh oh can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain

You're gone and I got to stay high
All the time to keep you off my mind, ooh ooh
High all the time to keep you off my mind, ooh ooh
Spend my days locked in a haze
Tryin' to forget you babe, I fall back down

🎤 Lyrics: The Chainsmokers - Closer ft. Halsey 

[Verse 1: Andrew Taggart]
Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much
And that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends
It was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

[Pre-Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no calls
Now you're lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

[Post-Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

[Verse 2: Halsey]
You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no call
Now I'm lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Halsey]
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

[Post-Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Halsey]
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

[Post-Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Halsey]
We ain't ever getting older
(No, we ain't ever getting older)
We ain't ever getting older
(No, we ain't ever getting older)
We ain't ever getting older
(We ain't ever getting older)
We ain't ever getting older
(No, we ain't ever getting older)
(We ain't ever getting older)
(No, we ain't ever getting older)

[Verse 1]
I will always remember the day you kissed me lips
Light as a feather
And it went just like this
No, it's never been better
Than the summer of 2002
We were only eleven
But acting like grownups
Like we are in the present, drinking from plastic cups
Singing love is forever and ever
Well, I guess that was true

[Pre-Chorus]
Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
Of an old Mustang, where we sang
Songs with all our childhoods friends
And it went like this, yeah

[Chorus]
Oops I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time
Paint a picture for you and me
Of the days when we were young
Singing at the top of both our lungs

[Verse 2]
Now we're under the covers
Fast forward to eighteen
We are more than lovers
Yeah, we are all we need
When we're holding each other
I'm taken back to 2002

[Pre-Chorus]
Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
Of an old Mustang, where we sang
Songs with all our childhoods friends
And it went like this, yeah

[Chorus]
Oops I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time
Paint a picture for you and me
Of the days when we were young
Singing at the top of both our lungs
On the day we fell in love
On the day we fell in love

[Pre-Chorus]
Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
Of an old Mustang, where we sang
Songs with all our childhoods friends
Oh, now

[Chorus]
Oops I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time
Paint a picture for you and me
Of the days when we were young
Singing at the top of both our lungs
On the day we fell in love
On the day we fell in love
On the day we fell in love
On the day we fell in love, love, love

About Anne-Marie:
Anne-Marie has proved to be one of the UK’s most exciting and successful British breakthrough popstars of recent years. A former 3x world karate champion and West End child star-turned 9x BRIT Award nominee, A-M’s rise has been nothing short of meteoric. In 2018 Anne-Marie released her debut album, ‘Speak Your Mind’ which featured the hit singles 'Alarm', 'Ciao Adios', 'Heavy', 'Friends', '2002' and 'Perfect to Me'. She subsequently ended that year as as the UK’s biggest-selling debut artist, selling out headline shows and playing stadium dates supporting long-time friend and champion Ed Sheeran in the process.

She has also sang on and co-written many other hits such as Birthday, Rockabye, Don't Leave Me Alone,  To Be Young, f*ck, i'm lonely and Don't Play, collaborating with the likes of Clean Bandit, Marshmello, David Guetta, Lauv, Rudimental, Doja Cat and KSI, as well as starring on The Greatest Showman: Reimagined soundtrack performing Rewrite the stars alongside James Arthur.

Lyrics:
I'm sorry, I'm not the most pretty
I'll never ever sing like Whitney
Ooh, but I still wanna dance with somebody(Tunechi)

So lets let our hearts bleed, 'til they turn to rust
Gonna live it up, 'cause it's dangerous
No, I don't wanna play the part (Amen)
I just wanna dance with somebody (Amen)
I just wanna dance with somebody (Yeah)

I just wanna dance with somebody
I just wanna dance with somebody
It could be anybody, tell me, are you that somebody?
Don't matter who you are, just love me the way I are
I just wanna dance with somebody
I just wanna dance with somebody

I just wanna dance with somebody
But I could never ever dance like Bobby
You can dance, I'ma watch your body
I just wanna stand right behind it
I just want a chance with somebody
Pop a couple xans with somebody
Every time she dance it's exotic
Throw a bunch of bands arms get tired
I'm the God I just want a goddess
Gotta use a bedroom for a closet
Got a whole bedroom, on the private
I know her body inside, out science
Kiss both boobs right before I sign 'em
Can't dance but kinda grind 'em
Yeah, I be right behind her, spinal
We can turn this dance floor to a island

I just wanna dance with somebody (Mula)
I just wanna dance with somebody
It could be anybody, tell me, are you that somebody?
(Tunechi)
Don't matter who you are, just love me the way I are
I just wanna dance with somebody
I just wanna dance with somebody

Bloody noses, speeding cars
Lethal doses, desperate hearts
Roll it up 'cause we so ill
Heaven knows we love the thrill
No, I don't wanna play the part
I just wanna dance with somebody
I just wanna dance with somebody

I just wanna dance with somebody (Mula)
I just wanna dance with somebody
It could be anybody, tell me, are you that somebody?
(Tunechi)
Don't matter who you are, just love me the way I are
I just wanna dance with somebody
I just wanna dance with somebody
I just wanna dance with somebody
I just wanna dance with somebody
It could be anybody, tell me, are you that somebody?
Don't matter who you are, just love me the way I are
I just wanna dance with somebody

LYRICS
Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything.

Uh!
I'm gonna kick my feet up
Then stare at the fan
Turn the TV on, throw my hand in my pants
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't

I'll be lounging on the couch,
Just chillin' in my snuggie
Click to MTV, so they can teach me how to dougie
'Cause in my castle I'm the freaking man

Oh, yes I said it
I said it
I said it 'cause I can

Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

Nothing at all!
Ooh, hoo, ooh, hoo, ooh, ooh-ooh
Nothing at all
Ooh, hoo, ooh, hoo, ooh, ooh-ooh

Tomorrow I'll wake up, do some P90X
Meet a really nice girl, have some really nice sex
And she's gonna scream out: 'This is Great' (Oh my God, this is great)
Yeah

I might mess around, get my college degree
I bet my old man will be so proud of me
But sorry pops, you'll just have to wait
Haha

Oh, yes I said it
I said it
I said it 'cause I can

Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

No, I ain't gonna comb my hair
'Cause I ain't going anywhere
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I'll just strut in my birthday suit
And let everything hang loose
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ooh
Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

Nothing at all
Nothing at all
Nothing at all

In 2019, Ed Sheeran released the genre-spanning ‘No.6 Collaborations Project’ which featured a wide-range of artists including ‘Justin Bieber’, ‘Camilla’ Cabello’, ‘Travis Scott’, ‘Eminem’, ‘Cardi B, ‘Paulo Londra’, ‘Bruno Mars’ and ‘Stormzy’ amongst many others, producing hits such as ‘I Don’t Care’, ‘Beautiful People’, ‘South of The Border’ and ‘Take Me Back To London’.

""Crush"" Lyrics:
VERSE 1
I can't focus on what needs to get done, I'm on notice hoping that you don't run
you think I'm tepid but I'm misdiagnosed, cause I'm a stalker I seen all of your posts
and I'm just trying to play it cool now but that's not what I want to do now
and I'm not trying to be with you now (you now)

you make it difficult to not overthink, and when I'm with you I turn all shades of pink
I want to touch you but don't want to be weird, it's such a rush I'm thinking wish you were here
and I'm just trying to play it cool now but that's not what I want to do now
and I'm not trying to be with you now (you now)

CHORUS

but I could be your crush like throw you for a rush like
hoping you'd text me so i could tell you I been thinking bout your touch like
touch touch touch touch touch I could be your crush crush crush crush crush
I got a fascination with your presentation making me
feel like you're on my island you're my permanent vacation
touch touch touch touch touch I could be your crush crush crush crush crush

VERSE 2

I fill my calendar with stuff I can do, maybe if I'm busy it could keep me from you
and I'm pretending you ain't been on my mind, but I took an interest in the things that you like
and I'm just trying to play it cool now but that's not what I want to do now
and I'm not trying to be with you now (you now)


BRIDGE

and yeah it's true that I'm a little bit intense right 
but can you blame me when you keep me on the fence like
and I been waiting hoping that you'd wanna text like (text like)
it's what I was born to do

🎤 Lyrics: I'm Yours - Jason Mraz

Well, you done done me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
Now I'm trying to get back

Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention.
I reckon, it's again my turn
To win some or learn some.

But I won't hesitate
No more, no more.
It cannot wait,
I'm yours.

Well, open up your mind and see like me,
Open up your plans and damn you're free.
Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love.
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing, we're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved

So I won't hesitate
No more, no more.
It cannot wait,
I'm sure.
There's no need to complicate.
Our time is short.
This is our fate,
I'm yours.

Do you want to come on, scooch on over closer, dear
And I will nibble your ear

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed.

I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons.
It's what we aim to do.
Our name is our virtue.

But I won't hesitate
No more, no more.
It cannot wait,
I'm yours.

Well, open up your mind and see like me,
Open up your plans and damn you're free.
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours.
So please don't, please don't, please don't...
There's no need to complicate.
'Cause our time is short.
This oh, this oh, this is our fate.
I'm yours.

Oh, I'm yours
Oh, I'm yours
Oh, oh,
Baby, do you believe, I'm yours?
You best believe, you best believe, I'm yours.

[Chorus]
I see your monsters I see your pain
Tell me your problems I’ll chase them away
I’ll be your lighthouse
I’ll make it okay
When I see your monsters
I’ll stand there so brave
And chase them all away

[Verse 1]
In the dark we we
We stand apart we we
Never see that the things that we need are staring right at us
You just want to hide hide hide
Hide never show your smile smile
Stand alone when you need someone it’s the hardest thing of all
That you see are the bad bad bad
Bad memories take your time and you’ll find me

[Chorus]
I see your monsters I see your pain
Tell me your problems I’ll chase them away
I’ll be your lighthouse I’ll make it okay
When I see your monsters I’ll stand there so brave
And chase them all away

[Verse 2]
I could see the sky sky sky
Sky beautiful tonight night
When you breathe why can’t you see the clouds are in your head
I would stay there there there
There’s no need to fear fear
And when you need to talk it out with someone you can trust
What you see are the bad bad bad
Bad memories take your time and you’ll find me

[Chorus]
I see your monsters I see your pain
Tell me your problems I’ll chase them away
I’ll be your lighthouse I’ll make it okay
When I see your monsters I’ll stand there so brave
And chase them all away
I'll chase them all away

[Bridge]
You've got the chance to see the light
Even in the darkest night
And i'll be here like you were for me
So just let me in..

[Chorus]
Cause I see your monsters I see your pain
Tell me your problems I’ll chase them away
I’ll be your lighthouse I’ll make it okay
When I see your monsters I’ll stand there so brave
And chase them all away

[Chorus]
I see your monsters I see your pain
Tell me your problems I’ll chase them away
I’ll be your lighthouse I’ll make it okay
When I see your monsters I’ll stand there so brave
And chase them all away

Lyrics:
In your eyes, there's a heavy blue
One to love, and one to lose
Sweet divine, a heavy truth
Water or wine, don't make me choose

I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night, night
Drunk on a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky

I've been running through the jungle
I've been running with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon
To get to you, to get to you
I've looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger
All for you, yeah, all for you
I've been running through the jungle
I've been crying with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you, to get to you

To get to you
To get to you

Your fingertips trace my skin
To places I have never been
Blindly, I am following
Break down these walls and come on in

I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night, night
Drunk on a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky

I've been running through the jungle
I've been running with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon
To get to you, to get to you
I've looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger
All for you, yeah, all for you
I've been running through the jungle
I've been crying with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you, to get to you

To get to you
To get to you

I've been running through the jungle
I've been running with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon
To get to you, to get to you
I've looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger
All for you, yeah, all for you
I've been running through the jungle
I've been crying with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you, to get to you

Why 432 Hz Tuned Music?
You may wonder why everyone fancy 432 Hz tuning with regard to music. This is due to its valuable healing energy associated with its heart soothing pure tones. 432 Hz commonly known as A=432 or Verdi's A is a standard pitch music tuning option regarded to be mathematically consistent with the universe.

All music tuned to Verdi's A is known to be clearer, bright and soft to the ears. This is the reason people favor it than other sound pitches. The softness and clarity offer listeners a relaxing and healing effect of their minds.

Popular 440 Hz pitch did not favor natural vibration. As a result, people would opt for 432 Hz which is more natural and does harmonize on any level corresponding to rhythm and natural vibration.

Benefits of Using 432 Hz-Tuned Music
- Its natural existence creates harmony among listeners. 
- It prevents the listener from psychotic symptoms paranoia and anxiety that are associated with 440 Hz.
- Its softness and clarity are ear-friendly as there is no need to play loud music. That would be necessary for other tuning options. Ear damages are highly minimized.

Dámelo
Woooo

Mr. Worldwide checking in
You know, it’s history in the making
Now mathematically this doesn’t make sense
But in this scenario, one plus one equals three
(Eeeyyyyoooooo)

I like her and she likes her, we gon’ have a love fest
One, two, tres, Ménage à trois
Let’s get down to business
Back it up, drop it low
Tap that like a bongo
I like them and they like me
It takes 3 to tango

Ladies and ladies, I am your gentleman
I open up double doors, now go ahead and come in
I got that Voli305 getting live
I’m in the iLov305 getting live

So many options so little time
A little bit of Erika with extra on the side
More and more for me
More and more for them
Switch up again and then switch back again

Two to one ratio
(mmmm c’est c’est c’est c’est la vie)
(ooh la la)
Two to one ratio
Round and round and round and round we go

I like her and she likes her, we gon’ have a love fest
One, two, tres, Ménage à trois
Let’s get down to business
Back it up, drop it low
Tap that like a bongo
I like them and they like me
It takes 3 to tango

Oooooyyeeeeeee
It takes three, it takes 3 to a tango
Oooooyyeeeeeee
It takes three, it takes 3 to a tango
Eeeyyyyoooooo (tango)

My reputation is notorious
It ain’t got to be serious
No time for mysterious
How bout’ we all get delirious 

Sí mamita, tú y tu amiguita 

Two to one ratio
(mmmm c’est c’est c’est c’est la vie)
(ooh la la)
Two to one ratio
Round and round and round and round we go
Eeeyyyyoooooo

I like her and she likes her, we gon’ have a love fest
One, two, tres, Ménage à trois
Let’s get down to business
Back it up, drop it low
Tap that like a bongo (woooooo)
I like them and they like me
It takes 3 to tango

Oooooyyeeeeeee
It takes three, it takes 3 to a tango
Oooooyyeeeeeee
It takes three, it takes 3 to a tango (tango)

everybody here at the party now

3, 2, tango

Two to one ratio
One plus one equals three
makes sense to me
Two to one ratio
Round and round and round and round we go
Round and round and round and round we go
Eeeyyyyoooooo

I like her and she likes her, we gon’ have a love fest
One, two, tres, Ménage à trois
Let’s get down to business
Back it up, drop it low
Tap that like a bongo
I like them and they like me
It takes 3 to tango
(Bbrrrraaattttt)

Oooooyyeeeeeee
It takes three, it takes 3 to a tango
(we gon’ have a love fest)
Oooooyyeeeeeee
It takes three, it takes 3 to a tango

Here are the official Drake In My Feelings Lyrics / Drake Kiki Do You Love Me Lyrics:
Trap, TrapMoneyBenny
This s**t got me in my feelings
Gotta be real with it, yuh

[Chorus 1: Drake]
Kiki, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always
KB, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always

[Verse: Drake]
Look, the new me is really still the real me
I swear you gotta feel me before they try and kiIl me
They gotta make some choices, they runnin' out of options
'Cause I've been goin' off and they don't know when it's stoppin'
And when you get to toppin', I see that you've been learnin'
And when I take you shoppin', you spend it like you earned it
And when you popped off on your ex he deserved it
I thought you were the one from the jump that confirmed it
TrapMoneyBenny
I buy you Champagne but you love some Henny
From the block like you Jenny
I know you special, girl, 'cause I know too many

[Chorus 2: Drake]
'Resha, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always
J.T., do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always

[Segue: City Girls, Drake & Magnolia Shorty]
Two bad b*tches and we kissin' in the Wraith
Kissin'-kissin' in the Wraith, kiss-kissin' in the Wraith
I need that black card and the code to the safe
Code to the safe, code-code to the safe-safe
I show him how that neck work
F*** that Netflix and chill—what's your net-net-net worth?
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always
Yea, yea, yea, yea he bad
And I'm down for you always
Yea, yea, yea, guess who's back
And I'm down for you always
D-down for you al–
Black biggy biggy black biggy black blake
D-d-down for you always
I got a new boy, and that n***a trade!

[Chorus 1: Drake]
Kiki, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want you, and I need you
And I'm down for you always
KB, do you love me? Are you riding?

[Breakdown: Lil Wayne & Magnolia Shorty]
Skate and Smoke and Rap
Now let me see you
Bring that a**, bring that a**, bring that a** back!
B-bring that a**, bring that a**, bring that a** back!
Shawty say the n***a that she with can't hit
But shawty, I'ma hit it, hit it like I can't miss
Now let me see you
Clap that a**, you're the only one I love
Clap that a**, clap-clap that a**!

Wow, this is pretty crazy, it's been almost three years since I uploaded this video and I am ASTOUNDED with the views and activities it's still getting. Thank you everybody, this is a great milestone for me.

*While I'm flattered that there are many copies of this video being re-uploaded to YouTube, I don't appreciate that many of these videos have been re-edit, remove my name and didn't credit me at all. Just give credit, not claim the mashup as yours, thank you.

----- v. 3.1 (FINAL version): http://youtu.be/VvkaCFkRORk

It is a new realization of my old idea to use the ""Love to see you cry"" video. I also edited the song a little bit, it is shorter than the original.

The song is from Enrique's album ""Insomniac"", 2007. Written by Enrique Iglesias & Kristian Lundin. No whales were hurt during the recording of this song.

**Lyrics**

( Intro )

I feel so love
I feel so love
I feel so love


( Chorus )

Taalmel najaron ka tujhse hua iss tarah
Jaise taal se mili ho sargam
In toofano ke beech kisi lehar ki tarah
Tu le gyi baha ke har gam

( Story Begins )

Mahine pahle ki hain baat
Ayi ghrpe kaatne raat
Dono baithe sath par
Ankhein na mila rhe
Chere pe thi chupi 
Chal rhe the hath hamare 
Side me vo baithi thi, jaise anjan koi
Ankhein uski sunn, jaise samshan koi
3 feet ka fasla tha, raas na tha
Milne laga rasta tha 
Wasta tha jaise koi salo se
Chahra uska chand
Or andhera nikle baalo se

Chahre the vo nervous se
Ghere the vo parvat se
Ankhein kabhi upper, kabhi neeche
Lahre vo jo badle rang
Chair pe tha main or bed pe vo baithi sang
Bhidne lage thode ang, rom rom jaag utha
Even devil falls
Jubaan se jaise raag utha
Hatho pe vo hath manne rakh diya glti se
Ankhien khuli meri or khada hua jldi se
Even i don't know what the hell was going on

Agle hi pal kamare se vo bhar thi
Battien barkraar thi
Hatho me raftaar thi
Likhe maine geet, bna main uska preet
Ho gyi subah, dhundta main rha?
Chahra na dikha, jaise din me chand ho chhupa
Sochta main rha, gyi vo kaha?
Le gyi vo gam sare, banke dard-ae-dawa
Chand ho chhupa

Banke hawa, shaam ko vo lauti
Shaitan jaisi ankhein, uski dikhti moti
Baal uske butt pr, kaan pe vo phone tha
Mirza aa gya usne phone pe hold on kaha?
Neeche loose rough jeans, upper white top tha
Mere bandhe lambe baal, chal me ek rob tha
Taaro si ankhon se vo ghurti rhi
Chle kya ghrpe vo puchti rhi

( Chorus Again )

Taalmel najaron ka tujhse hua iss tarah
Jaise taal se mili ho sargam
In toofano ke beech kisi lehar ki tarah
Tu le gyi baha ke har gam

( Last Verse )

Phuch gye ghrpe, raste me barse jo badal the
Kapade kiye change hamne hasne lage pagal se
Studio me aake baithe bajne lage ganne
Light ki cigratte maine, pass jake baith gya krke bhane 
Danto ke beech me neeche wala hoth uska 
Harley girl vo meri main uska joker
Fir sath dekhi subah hamne chand ko khokar

This is my first love song and i dedicate it to someone who means alot to me . I take this time to appreciate this girl who accepted the love that I offered some years back when I really had nothing as a man. I was broke , despised by many but still she chose me even when I couldn't see the best that was in me. she picked me up and always reminded me how special I  I'm and how lucky she was to have me. 
She gave me the best gift from God a man can receive through a woman that is a child. 
At an early age I became a father and this really changed everything  in my life most especially the way I see things it really pushed me. In everything I do I had to work extra hard to achieve what I want and I always want to make sure my daughter will not lack anything from his father. 
lastly things can get tough and rough sometimes 
If anything happens between us always remember nothing nuh last forever",l884wKofd54

6 Mayıs Perşembe

Olayların ortaya çıkmasından sonra babası Rafet'in gazabından kurtulamayan Sedat can havliyle işleri düzeltmeye çalışır.

Önce Cana'nın kapısını çalıp bir an önce kaçıp gitmelerini gerektiğini söyler. Ancak Cana'dan aldığı yanıt Sedat için hayal kırıklığıdır. Diğer taraftan Nalan da yaşadığı şeyler karşısında endişeli ve kararsızdır. Sedat ise öfkesinin kurbanı olur. 

Sinirli bir şekilde araba kullanırken gerektiğinden fazla hız yaptığından kaza geçirir. Sedat'ın kaza haberini alan tüm ailesi ise yastadır. Vicdan azabı çeken Cana da hastaneye gelir. Herkes Sedat'tan gelecek güzel haberi beklemektedir. Nalan da dahil olmak üzere. Ancak gelen bir haber tüm yaşanacakları temelinden sarsacaktır. Sedat'a ne olacak?

[Intro]
Wow
Yeah, yeah
We're back baby
Hey
Team 10
Let get it

[Verse 1: Jake Paul]
I got sauce, I got swagger
I got whips, I got M’s
My cars candy painted looking like some M&M's
I made it to the top, I had to bring my best friends
I'm a millionaire, from telling stories through a lens
Members leave Team 10, but I still collect their checks
Every single one of them and that includes my ex
(ah ah ah)
I'm the C.E.O, I'm the boss, T-Rex
My girl's body looking like she does P90X
I got some bad habits, like stunt, ball, flex

[Chorus: Jake Paul]
Flex, stunt, ball, it's a habit
Gucci, Louis, Prada, it's a habit
Rollie, Rollie, Rollie, it's a habit
I'm a savage, I'm a savage, Randy Savage
Backup! Let me flex, Randy Savage
(Backup, backup)
Backup! Let me flex, Randy Savage
(Backup, backup)
Backup! Let me flex, Randy Savage
I'm a savage, I'm a savage, Randy Savage
(Ya, Ya, Ya)

[Verse 2: Anthony Trujillo]
Randy off the top rope with a chair for your bitch ass
Pull up, that's your chick, hoppin' in to my jizzad
Fresh with the mer', bih you can check the tizzad
Only one night, now she claim I'm the bizzad
Flex
Flex on 'em
Flex on 'em
Dubs in Fortnite, I just sit and flex on em
Check after check, I just keep the checks coming
Been runnin with Jake since like, way before the money

[Verse 3: Quan]
Every day you know I'm flexin
Red bottoms when I'm stepping (Bloody moves)
Designer, that's a bad habit, Gucci, Louis, you must have it
Balling hard like a mad bitch (Swish)
Gettin' green like cabbage
Not 21, but I'm a savage
It's King Quan up next
Y'all rappers be average (Yeah)
Spittin' 'em, whippin' 'em, flippin' 'em checks
I'm finna be famous, more famous than that
Just let me focus all I do is flex
Look at their faces I got them upset
Bodies will do when I get on the track
Pull up in the Ghost and hop out the back
Remember the name King Quan up next

[Chorus: Jake Paul]
Flex, stunt, ball, it's a habit
Gucci, Louis, Prada, it's a habit
Rollie, Rollie, Rollie, it's a habit
I'm a savage, I'm a savage, Randy Savage
Backup! Let me flex, Randy Savage
(Backup, backup)
Backup! Let me flex, Randy Savage
(Backup, backup)
Backup! Let me flex, Randy Savage
I'm a savage, I'm a savage, Randy Savage

[Verse 4: Sunny]
Yeah, why you hating on the crew (crew)
Wait, let me catch my curfew
Hold up, yeah, I've been running up the checks, hold up (yeah)
Let me pull up and just flex (yeah)
Trying get in my way like it's a game
I got hundreds on my name, just tell them to catch the wave
I've been ballin all night, ballin' up all day
If you trying to get my name, just tell them they call me Drake

[Verse 5: Justin Roberts]
I'm the youngest one to do it in the game
A million followers just in five days
J-R spinning on my chest cause I'm paid
If you try to do it like me you just can't
I got J's on my feet, pinky ring it ain't cheap
Rob Mob every week, Team 10 we run deep
You don't got to compete no more
15 on the penthouse floor

[Chorus: Jake Paul]
Flex, stunt, ball it's a habit
Gucci, Louis, Prada, it's a habit
Rollie, Rollie, Rollie, it's a habit
I'm a savage, I'm a savage, Randy Savage
Back up, let me flex, Randy Savage
(backup, backup)
Let me flex Randy Savage
(backup, backup)
Let me flex Randy Savage
I'm a savage, I'm a savage, Randy Savage

[Verse 6: Erika Costell]
Rick and Team 10 in the zone right now
Got a whole new crew on the song right now
I can turn your girl to a star right now
8 million in 8 months get my whole damn crowd
I got a million, on a billion
Stack it up, stack it up
Till it's trillions, (yeah)
I'm a million (million), I be bossin' up (bossin' up)
You gotta check my receipt get your digits up (oh)

[Verse 7: Chad Tepper]
Whole life people took me as a joke (nope)

Red light, green light (brr), go
Yeah, I'm on the stage about to kill the show

[Verse 8: Jitt]
Ice around my neck like my neck hurt
I got millionaires in my net worth
Ballin' like the whiskey I'm a (?)
'Cause every time I rap they call it expert
Not 21 but I'm a savage like I'm macho
I'm the artist look at my art I'm like Picasso
You leveled up and you can meet me on the top floor
[?] if anybody's better I do not know

[Chorus: Jake Paul]
Flex, stunt, ball is a habit
Gucci, Louis, Prada, it's a habit
Rollie, Rollie, Rollie, it's a habit
I'm a savage, I'm a savage, Randy Savage
Back up, let me flex, Randy Savage
(back up, back, up)
Let me flex Randy Savage
(back up, back, up)
Let me flex Randy Savage
I'm a savage, I'm a savage, Randy Savage

Lyrics:
Nemoj da se ljutiš, hrabrost skupi
Jedna cura kao ja ne traži obećanja
Ne skidaš taj pogled ti sa mene
Lako ušla sam ja u tvoje vene

Osmeh tvoj mi kaže
Da me želiš koga lažeš
Slatka kao ćoko moko
Hajde budi loco

Ram ba-ba-bam
A ja slatka sam i fina
A ti si sam sam sam
I ja znam znam znam
Da biže lom lom lom
Zato hajde budi loco loco

Baby, baby, baby, čemu drama
Jedna cura kao ja ne traži obećanja
Baby, baby, baby, igram sama
To što nisi sa mnom to je tvoja mana

Osmeh tvoj mi kaže
Da me želiš koga lažeš
Slatka kao čoko moko
Hajde budi loco

1, 2... Girls, Come on!
Loco loco
Loco loco
Loco loco

Ne skidaš pogled sa mene
Lako sam ti ušla u vene
Hajde budi loco loco

A ja slatka sam i fina
A ti si sam sam sam
I ja znam znam znam
Da biće lom lom lom
Zato hajde budi loco loco
A ja slatka sam i fina
A ti si sam sam sam
I ja znam znam znam
Da biće lom lom lom
Zato hajde budi loco loco

Over the years, we’ve learned that music is far from the only thing that unites us. It‘s a scientific fact – we’re more similar than we ever could have imagined.

To prove our point, we dug into Eurovision’s heritage and found incredible connections between five Eurovision All Stars that you all know and love. 

Tonight, we’ll put these connections to the test and show you what it means to be one big Eurovision family.

Lyrics:
Imma godless
Spy imma spy I uncover
All of your secrets I want them There’s no stopping me now
I’m a liar
Playing the game of desire Ain’t gonna leave no survivors Would you fall for me now?
Just like Cleopatra The Army Of Lovers I start a fire
Yalan da men yanan da men yaman da men

Ma ma ma Mata Hari Mata Hari
[Ma ma ma ma
Ma ma ma ma
Ma ma ma ma]
Ma ma ma Mata Hari Mata Hari
[Ma ma ma ma
Ma ma ma ma
Ma ma ma ma
Ma ma ma ma] Mata Hari
Undercover
I am a dangerous lover Drinking my poisonous water and you’re under my spell
Mesmerising
Moving my hips you are trying you can’t resist, try to fight it Got a story to tell?
Just like Cleopatra The Army Of Lovers I start a fire
Yalan da men yanan da men yaman da men [Chorus]

Ma ma ma ma Ma ma ma ma Ma ma ma ma Ma ma ma ma
Just like Cleopatra Let’s start a fire Let’s go!

Ma ma ma ma Mata Hari
Ma ma ma ma Ma ma ma ma Mata Hari
Mata Hari

Be a player on my team huh
Be part of my en la vida
He’s coming in hot

I Love when he calls me Bonita Bonita was bonita 
Bonita, Si Bonita

Tómame Tómame soy el agua por tu sed
Tómame Tómame suave suave Otra vez
Acércate a mi ahora 
Yeah you got me feeling loca
Tómame Tómame suave suave Otra vez

Came in looking like a treat huh
Hop into my 2 seater
I think this one is a keeper
Hot like the summer in Antigua 

Now he wants some him and me time
Fly me out to Costa Rica
Got me burnin papito
He’s coming in hot gasolina-solina-gasolina

Tómame Tómame soy el agua por tu sed
Tómame Tómame suave suave Otra vez
Acércate a mi ahora 
Yeah you got me feeling loca
Tómame Tómame suave suave Otra vez

Lyrics:
Take a look what we've become
It's been so long
Getting you out of my life
I feel so strong
Set me free
Feel my beating heart in perfect
Harmony
Don't let me down
I'ma I'ma Ah
I’ma I’ma Ah
Feeling like in prison
Looking for the reason
I don't wanna say goodbye
Feels like no tomorrow
Everywhere that I go
Babe I'm gonna lose my mind
Just another story
Tell me not to worry
And everything will be just fine
Used to be your treasure
Now I'm gone forever
Think I'm going back in time
Set me free
Feel my beating heart in perfect
Harmony
Don't let me down

I’ma I’ma Ah
I'ma make it on my own
I’ma I’ma Ah
Chalas im hashigaon
X2
Life has been so easy
Used to call us cheesy
It was paradise

In my bed so lonely
You're the one and only
Hell I know I paid my price
Clock is ticking tik tak
Everything is chik chak
And I don't know what to do
People tell me honey
Yalla balagnim
One day dreams will become true
Set me free
Feel my beating heart in perfect
Harmony
Don't let me down
Set me free
Feel my beating heart in perfect
Harmony
Don't let me down
I’ma I’ma Ah
I'ma make it on my own
I’ma I’ma Ah
Chalas im hashigaon
X2
I’m so awesome
Come and get some
What are we living for?
I’m your reason
Spicy season
Like we did before
Let me take you higher
Set the place on fire
2021 degrees
Feel my beating heart and set me free
Set me free
Set me free
Set me free
Set me free
Harmony
Don’t let me down
Just set me free

Lyrics:
Fields, fields, fields
I’m so small
Fields, fields, fields
I’m too small
How do you cross a field through the fire?
How do you cross the field when you’re alone?

Heeeey?
Should I wait for a helpful hand?
What?
Who will reach out for me, girls?

For ages now
From night till dawn
From the deepest of the night
We are waiting for a ship
A sailing ship
Waiting very much
From night till dawn
Waiting for a ship
Waiting for a ship
But what’s the wait?
Stand up, let’s go!

Every Russian woman
needs to know
You strong enough to bounce against the wall

What’s the rattling about?
Hey, beauty!
Are you waiting for your prince?
Hey, beauty!

You’re 30!
Hello? Where are your kids?
You are cute overall
But should lose some weight
Wear something longer
Wear something shorter
Oh you grew up without a father?
You should do what you don’t want to

You sure you don’t want to?
Don’t want to?
You SHOULD!

Listen up, really!
We’re not a flock
Hey, crows, shoo!
Leave me alone (give me a break)
Now learn it by heart:
I don’t blame you for one bit
But I just love myself more

They just fight, always fight
Go round and round to just fight
But never pray
Boy without a father
Girl with no dad
But this broken family
Can’t break me

Lyrics:
Tonight we gonna burn in a party 
We wild as fire that’s on the loose 
Hotter than sriracha on our bodies 
T- taco - tamale - ya that’s my mood 
All this spicy melts my icy edges baby it’s true 
Tonight we gonna burn in a party 
It’s heaven in hell with you 

Mama mama cita 
Tell me what to do 
Lola lola loca 
I’m breaking the rules 

I fell in love I fell in love I gave my heart to El Diablo El Diablo 
I gave it up I gave it up because he tells me I’m his angel, I’m his angel 
Oh, El Diablo, El Diablo 
I fell in love I fell in love I gave my heart to El Diablo, El Diablo 

Tonight we gonna dance in the moonlight 
Droppin’ our lashes on the floor 
Hair flip flip made ya look twice 
Touch me touch me mi amor
All this spicy melts my icy edges baby for sure 
Tonight we gonna dance in the moonlight 
And then we gonna do it some more 

Mama mama cita 
Tell me what to do 
Lola lola loca 
I’m breaking the rules 

I fell in love I fell in love I gave my heart to El Diablo El Diablo 
I gave it up I gave it up because he tells me I’m his angel, I’m his angel

Στίχοι/Lyrics:

Το Κάτι που Έχεις

Δεν μ’ ενδιαφέρει τ'ακριβό σου το ρολόι
Δεν μ’ ενδιαφέρει αν έχεις χρήματα πολλά
Δεν μ’ ενδιαφέρει αν έχεις δύο μέτρα μπόι
Κι αν το κορμί σου είναι φωτιά
 
Δεν μ’ ενδιαφέρει το χρυσό piercing στη μύτη
Δεν μ’ ενδιαφέρει αν είσαι και καλά σερφάς
Δεν μ’ ενδιαφέρει αν έχεις τατουάζ μανίκι
Και μούσια τύπου χιπστεράς
 
Δεν μ’ ενδιαφέρουν οι ταχύτητες που τρέχεις
Oύτ' αν τ' αμάξι σου σε κάνει να πετάς
Δεν μ’ ενδιαφέρει το εξοχικό που έχεις
Κι αν με φλαμίνγκο κολυμπάς

Γιατί εσύ έχεις, γιατί το έχεις
Αυτό το κάτι που θέλω
Που μ’ έχει κάνει σαν τρελή να σε θέλω (x4)

Αυτό το κάτι
Το κάτι
Το κάτι
To κάτι…
 
Δεν μ’ ενδιαφέρει αν τα βράδια τριγυρίζεις
Δεν μ’ ενδιαφέρει καν αν στο Θεό με πας
Δεν μ’ ενδιαφέρει oύτε τι άρωμα μυρίζεις
ΟΚ εκτός κι αν είναι AXE
 
Δεν μ’ ενδιαφέρει αν κάνεις box ή καποεϊρα
Δεν μ’ ενδιαφέρει αν χορεύεις και break dance
Δεν μ’ ενδιαφέρει αν έχεις φίλη τη Φουρέιρα
Και απ' αυτήν πιο πολλούς fans

Γιατί εσύ έχεις, γιατί το έχεις
Αυτό το κάτι που θέλω
Που μ’ έχει κάνει σαν τρελή να σε θέλω

Αυτό το κάτι
Το κάτι
Το κάτι…

Γιατί εσύ έχεις, γιατί το έχεις
Αυτό το κάτι που θέλω
Που μ’ έχει κάνει σαν τρελή να σε θέλω

Αυτό το κάτι
Το κάτι
Το κάτι…

LAST DANCE (lyrics)

My heart was born a radical
Electric and dynamical
I've never listened to the remedies
With no forevers, no eternities

Holding on beyond the night
For a shadow that feels right
Holding on beyond the night
To you

If the dreams we made, are made of fire
I would give a life just to live the dream again
If our hearts are hanging on a wire
Let’s forget the world below and dance until the end

Let’s dance
Our last dance
Rocking romance
This ain’t our last dance

Let’s dance

My heart was born in neon lights
Floating in space like satellites
Looking for signs of life tonight
As we collide in black and white

Holding on beyond the night
For a shadow that feels right
Holding on beyond the night
To you

If the dreams we made, are made of fire
I would give a life just to live the dream again

Let’s dance
Our last dance
Rocking romance 
This ain’t our last dance

Let’s dance
This ain’t our last dance

Take a deeper breath before we touch
Running out of time, let’s use it up
And hold me before the morning comes

Let’s dance
Rocking romance
This ain’t our last dance

Let’s dance",eDSgs6syrgg

Σκηνοθεσία : Γιάννης Παπαδάκος

Στίχοι/Lyrics:
Ώρα να εξομολογηθώ,
Ένα λάθος δυνατό
Πως ακολουθώ
Νύχτα οι άμυνες με μια ματιά
Όλες πήρανε φωτιά πριν παραδοθώ

Έχει κάτι που το μυαλό μου παίρνει
Και πως ν' αντισταθώ δεν ξέρω
Έχει κάτι που η αμαρτία μοιάζει με κάτι θεικό
Και θέλω...

Ότι μέσα μου συμβαίνει
Με την ανάσα κομμένη,
Άλλο δεν θ' αναλύσω
Νιώθω το σφυγμό χτυπάει
Χρόνο αντίστροφα μετράει
Θα το ζήσω
3... 2... 1... και

Στο θεό με πάει όταν με κρατάει
Όπως κι αν φερθεί, ότι κι αν μου πει, μου πάει
Στο θεό με πάει, η καρδιά μου σπάει
Έχει επιρροή πάνω μου τρελή
Έχει τρόπο όλα να τα ζητάει
Και εγώ να του τα χαρίζω
Νιώθω το σφυγμό χτυπάει
Χρόνο αντίστροφα μετράει
Ναι, ναι, ναι, ναι
1... 2... 3... και
Στο θεό με πάει όταν με κρατάει
Όπως κι αν φερθεί, ότι κι αν μου πει, μου πάει
Στο θεό με πάει, η καρδιά μου σπάει
Έχει επιρροή πάνω μου τρελή

Στο θεό με πάει
Η καρδιά μου σπάει
Νύχτα οι άμυνες με μια ματιά
Όλες πήρανε φωτιά πριν παραδοθώ

Στο θεό με πάει όταν με ακουμπάει
Όπως κι αν φερθεί, ότι κι αν μου πει, μου πάει
Στο θεό με πάει, η καρδιά μου σπάει
Έχει επιρροή πάνω μου τρελή
Στο θεό με πάει
Η καρδιά μου σπάει

Υπο τη σκηνοθετική επιμέλεια του Γιάννη Παπαδάκου, η Ελένη Φουρέιρα και οι χορευτές της κατέκλυσαν τους δρόμους της Αθήνας και η μεγάλη επιτυχία «Στο Θεό Με Πάει» ακουγόταν δυνατά μέχρι τις πρώτες πρωινές ώρες.

Πρόκειται για την πολύ επιτυχημένη διασκευή της φετινής συμμετοχής του Ισραήλ στην Eurovision με τίτλο “Golden Boy” που ερμήνευσε ο Nadav Guedj, ο οποίος μάλιστα δε δίστασε να εκφράσει τον ενθουσιασμό του μόλις άκουσε την Ελληνική ερμηνεία του τραγουδιού του από την μοναδική Ελένη Φουρέιρα!!

Το δυναμικό official video clip κυκλοφορεί! Διαδώστε το!

✍️ Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
How long have you been smiling?
It seems like it's been too long
Some days I don't feel like trying
So what the fuck are you on?

[Pre-Chorus]
I think too much, we drink too much
Falling in love like it's just nothing
I want to know where do we go
When nothing's wrong

[Chorus]
'Cause all the kids are depressed
Nothing ever makes sense
I'm not feeling alright
Staying up 'til sunrise
And hoping shit is okay
Pretending we know things
I don't know what happened
My natural reaction is that we're scared
So I guess we're scared

[Verse 2]
But I can't really keep lying
'Cause I've been scared all along
Getting sick of sleeping in
While all my friends are popping pills
And I don't think that they're wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
I think too much, we drink too much
Falling apart like it's just nothing
I want to know where do we go
When nothing's wrong

[Chorus]
'Cause all the kids are depressed
Nothing ever makes sense
I'm not feeling alright
Staying up 'til sunrise
And hoping shit is okay
Pretending we know things
I don't know what happened
My natural reaction is that we're scared
So I guess we're scared

[Outro]
I won't deny it 'cause you dont' give me the words
I can't deny it if you won't give a fuck
So I'll start it out
You know I am so in love

Lyrics:
sun in my eyes
navy blue skies
you are the reason
i can survive
we’ll turn off the phones
to just be alone
we’ll draw the curtains
and never leave home
i had a nightmare
but now that i’m not scared
this is how you fall in love
let go and i’ll hold you up
so pull me tight and close your eyes
oh my love,
side to side
what’s easy is right
my mother’s advice
you are the reason
i never think twice
wherever we go
what glitters is gold
you’ll be my best friend
until we grow old
i had a nightmare
but now that i’m not scared
this is how you fall in love
let go and i’ll hold you up
so pull me tight and close your eyes
oh my love,
side to side

Lyrics

There's no reason, there's no rhyme
I found myself blindsided by
A feeling that I've never known
I'm dealing with it on my own
Phone is quiet, walls are bare
I drink myself to sleep, who cares?
No one even has to know
I'm dealing with it on my own

I've got way too much time to be this hurt
Somebody help, it's getting worse
What do you do with a broken heart?
Once the light fades, everything is dark
Way too much whiskey in my blood
I feel my body giving up
Can I hold on for another night?
What do I do with all this time?

Heavy thoughts when it gets late
Put me in a fragile state
I wish I wasn't going home
Dealing with it on my own
I'm praying but it's not enough
I'm done, I don't believe in love
Learning how to let it go
Dealing with it on my own

I've got way too much time to be this hurt
Somebody help, it's getting worse
What do you do with a broken heart?
Once the light fades, everything is dark
Way too much whiskey in my blood
I feel my body giving up
Can I hold on for another night?
What do I do with all this time? Yeah

I drive circles under street lights
Nothing seems to clear my mind
I can't forget
Get this out my head, so
I drive, chasing Malibu nights
Nothing seems to heal my mind
I can't forget

I've got way too much time to be this hurt
Somebody help, it's getting worse
What do you do with a broken heart?
Once the light fades, everything is dark
Way too much whiskey in my blood
I feel my body giving up
Can I hold on for another night?
What do I do with all this time? Yeah

I drive circles under street lights
Nothing seems to clear my mind
I can't forget
Get this out my head, so
I drive, chasing Malibu nights
Nothing seems to heal my mind
I can't forget
(Get this out my head, so)
I drive, chasing Malibu nights
Hey, yeah, na-na, ah yeah

Lyrics:

I thought
I would be good by now
I’d have it figured all out
We’d skip the scenic route
And oh, well
At least I never lied
Still I’m always the bad guy
So much for being nice

Cause I don’t wanna be someone who makes you happy
Then lets you down, we’ll both feel crappy
I’ll hate your friends when this shit ends
Well alright
And I don’t wanna make your momma cry at dinner
And see her at the mall next winter
At supercuts, she hates my guts
Well alright

Well I don’t
Don’t need a hand to hold
Don’t need you to console me
It’s honestly getting old
Well I’ve thought
Of so many places we could go
Well maybe I’m better off at home
Maybe I’m better on my own

Cause I don’t wanna be someone who makes you happy
Then lets you down, we’ll both feel crappy
I’ll hate your friends when this shit ends
Well alright
And I don’t wanna make your momma cry at dinner
And see her at the mall next winter
At supercuts, she hates my guts
Well alright

Find me drowning in this bullshit again
Started something that we’re just gonna end
Wonder if we would be better as friends
But we won’t

Cause I don’t wanna be someone who makes you happy
Then lets you down, we’ll both feel crappy
I’ll hate your friends when this shit ends
Well alright
And I don’t wanna make your momma cry at dinner
And see her at the mall next winter
At supercuts, she hates my guts
Well alright

LYRICS

All I know is (ooh ooh ooh)
We could go anywhere we could do
Anything girl whatever the mood we're in
All I know is (ooh ooh ooh)
Getting lost late at night under stars
Finding love standing right where we are your lips

They pull me in the moment
You and I alone and
People may be watching I don't mind ‘cause

Anywhere with you feels right
Anywhere with you feels like
Paris in the rain
Paris in the rain
We don't need a fancy town
Or bottles that we can't pronounce
Cause anywhere babe
Is like Paris in the rain
When I’m with you

I look at you now and I want this forever
I might not deserve it but there's nothing better
Don't know how I ever did it all without you
My heart is about to about to jump out of my chest
Feelings they come and they go that they do
Feelings they come and they go not with you

The late nights
And the street lights
And the people
Look at me girl
And the whole world could stop

Anywhere with you feels right
Anywhere with you feels like
Paris in the rain
Paris in the rain
We don't need a fancy town
Or bottles that we can't pronounce
Cause anywhere babe
Is like Paris in the rain
when im with you

Girl when I'm not with you
All I do is miss you
Come and set the mood right
Underneath the moonlight
Paint you with my eyes closed
Wonder where the time goes
Come and set the mood right
Underneath the moonlight

Anywhere with you feel right
Anywhere with you feels like
Paris in the rain
Walking down an empty street
Puddles underneath our feet

LYRICS: 
I will fight, I will fight for you
I always do, until my heart is black and blue
I will stay, I will stay with you
We'll make it to the other side, like lovers do
I'll reach my hands out, In the dark and wait for yours to interlock
I'll wait for you, I'll wait for you

Cuz' I'm not givin' up, I'm not givin' up, givin' up, no not yet
Even when I'm down to my last breath
Even when they say there's nothing's left
So don't give up on..

I'm not givin' up, I'm not givin' up, givin' up, no not me
Even when nobody else believes
I'm not goin down that easily
So don't give up on me

And I will hold, I'll hold onto you
No matter what this world will throw, it won't shake me loose
I'll reach my hands out, In the dark and wait for yours to interlock
I'll wait for you, I'll wait for you

Cuz' I'm not givin' up, I'm not givin' up, givin' up, no not yet
Even when I'm down to my last breath
Even when they say there's nothing's left
So don't give up on..

I'm not givin' up, I'm not givin' up, givin' up, no not me
Even when nobody else believes
I'm not goin down that easily
So don't give up on me

Yeah (x7)

I will fight, I will fight for you 
I always do until my heart is black and blue

Lyrics for ""idfc"" by blackbear

[Verse]
Tell me pretty lies, look me in the face
Tell me that you love me, even if it's fake
'Cause I don't f*cking care at all
You been out all night, I don't know where you been
You're slurring all your words, not making any sense
But I don't f*cking care at all

[Chorus]
'Cause I have hella feelings for you
I act like I don't f*cking care
Like they ain't even there
'Cause I have hella feelings for you
I act like I don't f*cking care
'Cause I'm so f*cking scared

[Post-Chorus]
I'm only a fool for you
And maybe you're too good for me
I'm only a fool for you
But I don't f*cking care at all

[Verse]
Tell me pretty lies, look me in the face
Tell me that you love me, even if it's fake
'Cause I don't f*cking care at all
You been out all night, I don't know where you been
You slurring all your words, not making any sense
But I don't f*cking care at all

[Chorus]
'Cause I have hella feelings for you
I act like I don't f*cking care
Like they ain't even there
'Cause I have hella feelings for you
I act like I don't f*cking care
'Cause I'm so f*cking scared

[Post-Chorus]
I'm only a fool for you
And maybe you're too good for me
I'm only a fool for you
But I don't f*cking care at all

Lyrics

Wandering the streets all through the night,
Searching for the one to make me right.
Wondering if she's the shade of you,
And If so, should I try to see it through.

Darling, I got my trust issues.
Warning, you stay away.
If we meet at the rendezvous,
take me away, Sunray

Time and toys,
May fill my heart with joy,
I'll know peace when I'm your lover boy.

I'll be your new school soul.
Silver and gold.
New desire.
Friends on fire.
Call me 'lover boy'",uKxWP56VStM

Lyrics:
I can’t wait for you
to come my way
I’ve been far away
But I’ll keep runnin’ 
Just to find a way to you til’ then

I been running from it 
Tired of running from it  
Scared of feeling something now I’m stuck and tryna get up out of this hole 
I tried to be strong 
I tried to make it work but I’ve been feeling so numb 
Skies are bleeding on me 
Why’d you leave me lonely 
Feeling Whitney Stoney now I’m stuck and wonder where I ever went wrong 
How could I be strong 
I’m fighting for your love 

I can’t wait for you
to come my way
I’ve been far away
But I’ll keep runnin’ 
Just to find a way to you til’ then

I don’t see light in your love anymore
There ain’t no reason in pourin a 4
I don’t like feelings or feeling like running from something and feeling so out of control
I know that the feeling is gone
I’m spending too much time alone
I’m hopin’ you pick up the phone
And ring me when you wanna stay overnight
My shoulders right, my baby is all that I want
I’ll play them all of my favorite songs
That lady is my favorite one

I can’t wait for you
to come my way
I’ve been far away
But I’ll keep runnin’ 
Just to find a way to you til’ then

Ain’t never gonna let ya go 
Got my heart nascar racing 
Shine ain’t ever fading 
He just left ya hangin’
Fiendin for ya love 
All worth it for the waiting
give you what you need 
take you where he won’t
Can feel it when we’re all alone
Know your wanting something more
My heart is like an open door
Just ring me when you wanna go

I’ll wait 
Till you’re home
hold a place till you’re comin home
Show you where the garden grows
Just ring me when you wanna go

I can’t wait for you
to come my way
I’ve been far away
But I’ll keep runnin’ 
Just to find a way to you til’ then",uKxWP56VStM

LYRICS
Small talk, no conversation
That look makes me impatient
I can’t tell what you’re thinking
Please tell me what you’re thinking
Last night we were more than fine
Just tell me if you changed your mind
If you changed your mind

Cause I’m all, I’m all in
Calling, no answer
Would you text me when you feel like
When it feels right to you
But I’m all, I’m all in
I’m falling faster
If you’re looking at me with a heart of doubt

Don’t kiss me right now
Don’t tell me that you need me
Don’t show up at my house
All caught up in your feelings
Don’t run me round and round
Don’t build me up just to let me down
Just to let me down, down, down (hey)
Don’t mess with my head
Don’t tell me you’re falling with your feet still on the ledge
I’m all out of breath
Baby, don’t run me round and round
Don’t kiss me, no, don’t kiss me right now
On your lips just leave it
If you don’t mean it

Ooh yeah
You know you’ve got me in the palm of your hand
But I love those hands
Oooh yeah
But you only let me hold you when he can’t
Yeah, I don’t understand
Cause I’m all, I’m all in
I’m calling, no answer
Would you text me when you feel like
When it feels right to you
But I’m all, I’m all in
I’m falling faster
If you’re looking at me with a heart of doubt

Don’t kiss me right now
Don’t tell me that you need me
Don’t show up at my house
All caught up in your feelings
Don’t run me round and round
Don’t build me up just to let me down
Just to let me down, down, down (hey)
Don’t mess with my head
Don’t tell me you’re falling with your feet still on the ledge
I’m all out of breath
Baby, don’t run me round and round
Don’t kiss me, no, don’t kiss me right now
On your lips just leave it
If you don’t mean it

Hurry home, let’s never leave the house (but you don’t mean it)
Let’s stay in bed while all our friends go out (but you don’t mean it)
Why you let those words come out of your mouth (if you don’t mean it)
You’ve been staring at me with a heart of doubt

Don’t kiss me right now
Don’t tell me that you need me
Don’t show up at my house
All caught up in your feelings
Don’t run me round and round
Don’t build me up just to let me down
Just to let me down, down, down (hey)
Don’t mess with my head
Don’t tell me you’re falling with your feet still on the ledge

Lyrics:

I thought
I would be good by now
I’d have it figured all out
We’d skip the scenic route
And oh, well
At least I never lied
Still I’m always the bad guy
So much for being nice

Cause I don’t wanna be someone who makes you happy
Then lets you down, we’ll both feel crappy
I’ll hate your friends when this shit ends
Well alright
And I don’t wanna make your momma cry at dinner
And see her at the mall next winter
At supercuts, she hates my guts
Well alright

Well I don’t
Don’t need a hand to hold
Don’t need you to console me
It’s honestly getting old
Well I’ve thought
Of so many places we could go
Well maybe I’m better off at home
Maybe I’m better on my own

Cause I don’t wanna be someone who makes you happy
Then lets you down, we’ll both feel crappy
I’ll hate your friends when this shit ends
Well alright
And I don’t wanna make your momma cry at dinner
And see her at the mall next winter
At supercuts, she hates my guts
Well alright

Find me drowning in this bullshit again
Started something that we’re just gonna end
Wonder if we would be better as friends
But we won’t

Cause I don’t wanna be someone who makes you happy
Then lets you down, we’ll both feel crappy
I’ll hate your friends when this shit ends
Well alright
And I don’t wanna make your momma cry at dinner
And see her at the mall next winter
At supercuts, she hates my guts
Well alright

Lyrics for ""Eli. - Worthless""

[Verse 1]
I'm always so alone
Even when surrounded
By people that I know
I'm always so astounded
By my ability to ruin everything
Losing friends and starting fires
Everyone thinks I'm a liar

I always stay at home
Cause I'm not good in public
I sit here on my phone
I'm always disappointed
I watch them live their lives
I wish that I were happy
Victim of my generation
Time machines cannot erase it

[Pre-Chorus]
Who am I supposed to be?
When will I be complete?
When will they be proud of me?
It's getting harder to see

[Chorus]
Slit my wrists, bloody fists
Questioning why I exist
Pain persists, evil gifts
Fucking up my life to shit
I'm worthless, I'm worthless
I'm worthless, slit my wrists until I bleed out

[Verse 2]
I try to stay strong
No matter what I do
I'm always in the wrong
It never gets easier
But maybe that's the point
It's part of growing up
Messing up and learning from it
That's just life, it's necessary

Clinging to hope
What else is there to live for?
Got nowhere to go
What else is pain good for?
I am confident that your life has a purpose
It's okay, you will get through it
Don't give up cause someone needs you

[Pre-Chorus]
Who am I supposed to be?
When will I be complete?
When will they be proud of me?
It's getting harder to see

[Chorus]
Slit my wrists, bloody fists
Questioning why I exist
Pain persists, evil gifts
Fucking up my life to shit
I'm worthless, I'm worthless
I'm worthless, slit my wrists until I bleed out

[Bridge]
Please, don't give up
Gotta stay strong, gotta move on
Gotta know hope when you feel low
Please, you gotta know
That someone needs you

Please, don't give up
Gotta stay strong, gotta move on
Gotta know hope when you feel low
Please, you gotta know
That someone needs you

[Chorus]
Slit my wrists, bloody fists
Questioning why I exist
Pain persists, evil gifts
Fucking up my life to shit
I'm worthless, I'm worthless
I'm worthless, slit my wrists until I bleed out
Worthless, I'm worthless
I'm worthless, slit my wrists until I bleed out

✍️ Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
How long have you been smiling?
It seems like it's been too long
Some days I don't feel like trying
So what the fuck are you on?

[Pre-Chorus]
I think too much, we drink too much
Falling in love like it's just nothing
I want to know where do we go
When nothing's wrong

[Chorus]
'Cause all the kids are depressed
Nothing ever makes sense
I'm not feeling alright
Staying up 'til sunrise
And hoping shit is okay
Pretending we know things
I don't know what happened
My natural reaction is that we're scared
So I guess we're scared

[Verse 2]
But I can't really keep lying
'Cause I've been scared all along
Getting sick of sleeping in
While all my friends are popping pills
And I don't think that they're wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
I think too much, we drink too much
Falling apart like it's just nothing
I want to know where do we go
When nothing's wrong

[Chorus]
'Cause all the kids are depressed
Nothing ever makes sense
I'm not feeling alright
Staying up 'til sunrise
And hoping shit is okay
Pretending we know things
I don't know what happened
My natural reaction is that we're scared
So I guess we're scared

[Outro]
I won't deny it 'cause you dont' give me the words
I can't deny it if you won't give a fuck
So I'll start it out
You know I am so in love

uLGDEG_dTnw,,5 Signs of Teenage Depression,Psych2Go,,2018-12-04T04:15:11Z,,,,,,,,,,"About 20 percent of all teens experience depression before they reach adulthood. Between 10 to 15 percent suffer from symptoms at any one time. Only 30 percent of depressed teens are being treated. Symptoms of teenage depression can include, but not limited to: prolonged low mood or sadness, being easily irritable, feelings of helplessness, increased social isolation, loss of interest for things previously enjoyed. The signs of depression can resemble that of clinical depression. If you suspect that you may be experiencing signs of depression, it is recommended that you seek a professional. 

We're also partnered with BetterHelp, where you could get online counseling at an affordable rate. You must be 18+ :

Lyrics:

V1:
Mirror mirror on the wall 
Tunnel vision on the flaws
In the scale of things it’s unimportant
So no talking but it’s still an intrusive thought

Tried hard to correct it
But nothing was effective
No-one else seemed so obsessed with it, things were desperate
Until the voice crept in

I can help you, trust me, you’re ready

It seemed dangerous
But it said to have faith in it

The secret is to just be empty

Didn’t know if it was wise to listen
But what could it hurt to try?

P1:
And at first it was working 
But then things were emerging 
Cracked lips and Tired eyes 
I’m hungry with no appetite

I’m shivering and shaking, and I tell myself it’s fine, but
You can’t fool your body, you can only fool your mind, yuh

Empty
I just need to be empty
Hide from anybody who’ll prevent me
Just fill up on water and shame
No, I’m not hungry, I just ate

I’ve developed a taste for this
Endure the neverending ache
Convince myself I’m in control and it’s not
All that voice that makes me sick

C:
Inside it’s empty
Ana- I know it’s wrong
I’m looking but I can’t see myself

Inside it’s empty
Ana- I know it’s wrong
But it’s so hard to stop it alone

V2:
Been getting even worse
All the days begin to merge
Just a blurry haze and now it’s
Almost second nature to ignore the urges

Can’t trust my own nature
Every calorie a failure
Gotta push the intake down every day
‘Cause the voice comes back to say

You want to eat?   Bite your tongue

Don’t want to stay an embarrassment
just have to stomach it

They don't know what you want
A tug of war against common sense
don’t wanna believe that I’ve overstepped

P2:
But it’s so overwhelming
And I hope no-one can tell
‘Cause the numbers keep decreasing
This ordeal is becoming routine, check

Arms back neck thighs Suck it in and Pinch my sides
The scales are betraying me, the mirror is a lie, yeah

Numbers
It all comes down to numbers
I know it’s wrong but
Just because you know you’re colorblind 
doesn’t mean you can see the colors

Fine, I admit I’m addicted
But the hunger feels good, how do I quit this
I know I could die, I’ve seen the statistics
But the voice is with me through thick and thin

Bridge:
I can reach out
To someone not like me
If you ask for help it doesn’t make you weak

I can reach out
ignore what the voice tells me
I can help my mind learn to trust my body

LYRICS:


Dil se dil ki yeh baatein
Hum ne sab kehdi
Tum ne ho mere jana
Sab sunliya hai pal bhar me hi

Dil ke aasman me
Hum do udti patang

Khwabo se nikall aao
Bohut hui luka chupi

Tu aye
Le jaye
Muskuraaye
Hooo hooo hooo 

Tu aye
Le jaye
Muskuraaye
Hooo hooo hooo 

Khuli aankhon se dekha sapna hum dono ka
Baatein tumse karu me
Mere khwabo main bhi

Dil ki in kitbao me 
Hum do perfect couple

Haale dil ki kahani
Tumse keh na paya

Tu aye
Le jaye
Muskuraaye
Hooo hooo hooo 

Tu aye
Le jaye
Muskuraaye
Hooo hooo hooo 

Dil ke iss seher me
Bahot se chupe woh raaz
Kholo tum band darwaze
Baahon main aao na

Aake dil ki zameen pe
Bhardo tum rang yahan
Tumse hi toh main hu
Tere sang khushiyaan yahaan 

Tu aye
Le jaye
Muskuraaye
Hooo hooo hooo 

Tu aye
Le jaye
Muskuraaye
Hooo hooo hooo 

The End.",uKxWP56VStM

LYRICS
Undo these chains, my friend. I’ll show you the rage I’ve hidden.
Perish the Sacrament. Swallow, but nothing’s forgiven.
You and I can’t decide which of us was taken for granted.
Make amends… some of us are destined to be outlived.

STEP INSIDE/ SEE THE DEVIL IN I
Too many times, we’ve let it come to this
STEP INSIDE/ SEE THE DEVIL IN I
You’ll realize I’m not your Devil anymore

Under the words of men, something is tempting the father.
Where is your will, my friend? Insatiates never even bother.
You and I, wrong or right, traded a lie for the leverage.
In between the lens in light, you’re not what you seem.

STEP INSIDE/ SEE THE DEVIL IN I
Too many times, we’ve let it come to this
STEP INSIDE/ SEE THE DEVIL IN I
You’ll realize I’m not your Devil…
I’m Not Your Devil Anymore

Your Station- Is Abandoned- Fool You ‘cause I know what you’ve done
Sensation- Depravation- You should’ve burned when you turned on everyone

SO STEP INSIDE/ SEE THE DEVIL IN I
Too many times, we’ve let it come to this
STEP INSIDE/ SEE THE DEVIL IN I
Oh, when all that’s left does not make sense
STEP INSIDE/ SEE THE DEVIL IN I
I know you’ll find your answers in the end
STEP INSIDE/ SEE THE DEVIL IN I

America is a beautiful idea that draws immigrants like myself from all over the world to the promised land of equality, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. This idea is now under siege and certain events are starting to remind me of the things many of us came here to escape... It’s not a “left against right” problem but an evolutionary problem. The growing pains of a civilization that without the necessary spiritual enlightenment, arrived a bit early to a level of technology where everyone is connected. The good news is that now everyone has a voice. The bad news is that now everyone has a voice. So we are living in the manipulators’ paradise, where liars and hypocrites run unscathed, the news are just opinions, politics are a blood sport, and facts are determined by consensus instead of the truth. We as artists, however, have a unique opportunity to portray and ridicule the absurd to prevent it from becoming reality. 
- Zoltan Bathory

Lyrics:
Watch your tongue or have it cut from your head
Save your life by keeping whispers unsaid
Children roam the streets now orphans of war
Bodies hanging in the streets to adore
Royal flames will carve a path in chaos, bringing daylight to the night
Death is riding into town with armor, they've come to take all your rights
Hail to the King
Hail to the One
Kneel to the crown
Stand in the sun
Hail to the King
Hail, Hail, Hail the King
Blood is spilt while holding keys to the throne.
Born again but it's too late to atone.
No mercy -- from the edge of the blade
Dare escape and learn the price to be paid
Let the water flow with shades of red now, Arrows black out all the light
Death is riding into town with armor, they've come to grant you your rights
Hail to the King
Hail to the One
Kneel to the crown
Stand in the sun
Hail to the King
Hail, Hail, Hail the King
There's a taste of fear
When the henchmen call
Iron fist to tame the land
Iron fist to claim it all
Hail to the King
Hail to the One
Kneel to the crown
Stand in the sun
Hail to the King
Hail, Hail, Hail the King

Disturbed is a multi-platinum-selling heavy metal band renowned for their hits “Down With The Sickness,” “Sound of Silence,” “The Vengeful One,” “The Light,” “Stricken,” “Land Of Confusion,” and “Indestructible.” They worked with artists like Myles Kennedy, and Lzzy Hale — amassing billions of global streams and achieving 5 consecutive number one debuts on the Billboard Top 200.

Lyrics:
Hello, darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping

And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp

When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening

People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools,"" said I, """"You do not know
Silence, like a cancer, grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""""

But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said
""The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whispered in the sound
Of silence""

Bad Wolves - Zombie (Lyrics):

Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence causes silence
Who are we mistaken?

But you see, it's not me
It's not my family
In your head, in your head, they are fighting
With their tanks, and their bombs
And their bombs, and their drones
In your head, in your head, they are crying

What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh
Another mother's breakin'
Heart is takin' over
When the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken

It's the same old theme
In two thousand eighteen
In your head, in your head, they're still fightin'
With their tanks, and their bombs
And their guns, and their drones
In your head, in your head, they are dyin'

What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh

It's the same old theme
In two thousand eight-teen
In your head, in your head, they're dyin'

What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie,

Oh oh oh oh 
Ie-ie, oh

Lyrics:

What a world/the horizon’s coming like a hell bent killing machine
Can’t afford to be the goddamn wreckage- burn it all again at a million degrees
Calling all the adamant upper-level undefeated counterfeit cunts w/ a reason to fear
Throw away all the meaningless shit that’s clinging/the Enemy is here
I said stop… give it to 3- I’m going to show you how to do it if you know what I mean
One By One Against- Give Me The Name
All You Shiny Pretty Never-Wills Ruined The Game
We Hold All The Keys So The Chains Shouldn’t Hold You
I Know You Heard Me- I Fucking Told You
OLD DOES NOT MEAN DEAD-NEW DOES NOT MEAN BEST
NO HARD FEELINGS-I’M TIRED OF BEING RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING I’VE
SAID
YOURS DOES NOT MEAN MINE-KILL DOES NOT MEAN DIE
WE ARE NOT YOUR KIND-NO EXCUSES
I CHALLENGE YOU TO ALL-OUT-LIFE
Drop that shit and put it on a pedestal-children are afraid of the Gods
Raise your hands and show me what’s impossible
That makes us even-never tell me the odds
What a Bore/I’m getting stuck in a metaphor/I don’t want to go to sleep
I need a breakdown quick in negotiations-get it all together and remember to seethe
Stop… give it to 3- I’m going to show you how to do it if you know what I mean
Drive By Violence-More Of The Same
I Can See Where You’re Going And I’m Really Ashamed
Do You Think When You Act Or Just Act Like You’re Thinking?
I Got To Know Now- You Better Tell Me
OLD DOES NOT MEAN DEAD-NEW DOES NOT MEAN BEST
NO HARD FEELINGS-I’M TIRED OF BEING RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING I’VE
SAID
YOURS DOES NOT MEAN MINE-KILL DOES NOT MEAN DIE
WE ARE NOT YOUR KIND-I CHALLENGE YOU TO ALL-OUT-LIFE
We are gathered here today to get it right… repeat after me
I WILL NOT CELEBRATE MEDIOCRITY- I WILL NOT WORSHIP EMPTY
SHELLS
I WILL NOT LISTEN TO WORTHLESS NOISES
I WILL NOT SUBJECT MYSELF TO SELECTED PREDICTABLE CHOICES
MY TIME-MY ATTENTION-MY QUALITY SHOULD NOT BE BOUGHT AND
SOLD
FOR CONVENIENCE’S SAKE… EVER
WE ARE NOT YOUR KIND
OLD DOES NOT MEAN DEAD-NEW DOES NOT MEAN BEST
NO HARD FEELINGS-I’M TIRED OF BEING RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING I’VE
SAID
YOURS DOES NOT MEAN MINE-KILL DOES NOT MEAN DIE
PAY ATTENTION-IT’S GOING TO BE AWHILE TIL I REALLY FEEL ALRIGHT
OLD DOES NOT MEAN DEAD-NEW DOES NOT MEAN BEST
NO HARD FEELINGS-I’M TIRED OF BEING RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING I’VE
SAID
YOURS DOES NOT MEAN MINE-KILL DOES NOT MEAN DIE
WE ARE NOT YOUR KIND-NO EXCUSES
I CHALLENGE YOU TO ALL OUT FUCKING LIFE",HbaQ9xnoMGQ

""Buried Alive"" Lyrics: 

Take the time just to listen
When the voices screaming are much too loud,
Take a look in the distance,
Try and see it all,
Chances are that ya might find,
That we share a common discomfort now
I feel I'm walking a fine line
Tell me only if it's real

Still I'm on my way,
On and on it goes,
Vacant hope to take

Hey - I can't live in here for another day
Darkness has kept the light concealed
Grim as ever
Hold on to faith as I dig another grave
Meanwhile the mice endure the wheel
Real as ever
And it seems I've been buried alive

I walk the fields through the fire,
Taking steps until I found solid ground
Followed dreams reaching higher
Couldn't survive the fall
Much has changed since the last time
And I feel a little less certain now
You know I jumped at the first sign
Tell me only if it's real
Memories seem to fade
On and on it goes
Wash my view away

Hey - I can't live in here for another day
Darkness has kept the light concealed
Grim as ever
Hold on to faith as I dig another grave
Meanwhile the mice endure the wheel
Real as ever
And I'm chained like a slave, trapped in the dark
Slammed all the locks, death calls my name
And it seems I've been buried alive

Take you down now, burn it all out
Throw you all around, get your fuckin'
HANDS OFF ME!
What's it feel like? Took the wrong route
Watch it fall apart now you're knockin' AT THE WRONG GATE!
For you to pay the toll, a price for you alone
The only deal you'll find, I'll gladly take your soul

While it seems sick, sober up quick
Psycho lunatic crushing you with
HANDS OF FATE!
Shame to find out, when it's too late
But you're all the same
Trapped inside INFERNO AWAITS!
Evil thoughts can hide, I'll help release the mind
I'll peel away the skin, release the dark within

This is now your life
Strike you from the light
This is now your life
Die, buried alive
This is now your life (what's it feel like)
Strike you from the light (let me take in your soul)
This is now your life (what's it feel like)
Die, buried alive (let me take in your soul)
This is now your life
Die, buried alive!",HbaQ9xnoMGQ

LYRICS:
Beware the serpents in the leaves,
& their deception,
An outstretched h&, Closed to a fist,
Becomes a weapon.

I see the damage they have done.
I see the battle’s just begun.
I know the answer lies inside,
I feel it when I close my eyes.

Through disaster & decay,
Survive to fight another day.
When there's no time for you to question,
Every single step you take,
Press on, & trust in your instincts.

Break down the barriers of fear,
& superstition.
Listen to your primal past,
& intuition.

You'll see the damage they have done
You'll see the war is never won,
You'll know the answer lies inside.
You'll feel it when you close your eyes.

Kill or be killed, (stand & fight)
sink or swim, (run & hide)
The answer lies within

LYRICS:
I'm the angel of the dead.
Take a good look at me.
Grief is my guilty pleasure.
I'm taking comfort in your pain.
My happiness is your defeat.
Your heartache makes me feel so complete. 
The compliments roll in and remind me I'm a good friend.
I'm here for you until the end. 
Open the door.
Let me in.
I need you, and you need me too.
Open the door.
Let me in.
I am the king, king of sorrow.
Bow to me now.
Give me your tears.
I am the king, king of sorrow.
Rest assured that everything will be ok.
It's all going according to plan.
Let me speak for you in these times of dread.
I'll be your guide, now please just rest your head.
I am your dead ringer.
If it bleeds then it leads.
Misery loves company, and you've just met your match.
Open the door.
I'll leave you be.
Thank your for your sympathy.
Open the door.
I'll leave you be.
I am the saint of empathy.
Farewell.
I've consumed all that I need.
Farewell.

LYRICS:
It takes time to blow.
Say it ain't so.

Stuck in the middle of it.
Too wise to know.
Oh here we go.
We’ve grown so used to it.

So numb all the time.
How have we become so empty?

Overcomplicated.
We’re all to blame.
Oversaturated.
It’s such a shame.

It's all who you know.
Death undertow.
We all fall victim to it.
All chemical.
Where have we gone?
Are we just used to this?

So numb all the time.
How have we become so empty?

Overcomplicated.
We’re all to blame.
Oversaturated.
It’s such a shame.

If we cannot feel how can we heal at all?
If we’re overmedicated.
We’re all to blame.

Here we are once again.
How'd we get here?
Will it end?

Look at you lost with separation, complicated.
There’s no one left to blame.
You’re just a shell of a man left wasted, medicated.
I’m standing on the outside looking in.

Overcomplicated.
We’re all to blame.
Oversaturated.
It’s such a shame.

If we cannot feel how can we heal at all?
If we’re overmedicated.
If we’re all to blame.

Am I cursed, or did I do this to myself?
Circling around and around like a Saint that never closes its eyes, you deny
With your hands held tight you avoided the light

I drank from the cup of eternal disease,
I once was a blind man but now I can see

I should have known you were the lord of flies
Looking for heaven in the Devils eyes
Guiding the stars to pave my own demise
I should have known you were the lord of flies

You're the worst, but I can see you in myself
Broken but enough is enough
Just a wretch that never opens its eyes you deny
With a voice so loud permeating the night

I'll never forgive
No, I'll never concede
The worst that you've done's still got nothin on me

I should've known you fill my head with lies
I was looking for heaven in the Devils eyes",HbaQ9xnoMGQ

Lyrics

Do you see me 
Do you see what I’ve become 
I’m not the same beast 
I leave a scar on all I touch 
You think you know me now 
Is it better than I know myself 
I know it hurts like hell 
Admitting just how you’ve misjudged 
All my life I’ve been told the same old 
Don’t step out, don’t test the mould 
We know your kind, yeah we know you 
So much better than you know yourself 
See, the ones that won’t engage me 
Are the same trying to cage me 
But I can’t sit still and I won’t be tame 
When the lights go out 
Better know your enemy 
Because I’ve spent a lifetime shadowboxing with death 
And we’ll dance with the devil ‘til there’s no songs left 
So do you see me 
Do you see what I’ve become 
I’m not the same beast, no 
I leave a scar on all I touch 
You think you know me now 
Is it better than I know myself 
I know it hurts like hell 
Admitting just how you’ve misjudged 
You don’t know me, you cannot own me 
The path I’m on don’t fit the old me 
I bare my soul as I keel evolving 
And I chase this taste for blood 
See, I learned real young, don’t seek no gold 
Trust no fool and you won’t get sold 
I never feared the dark 
No, I just became it 
When the lights go dead 
You better pray you’re safe kid 
Because I’ve spent a lifetime shadowboxing with death 
And we’ll dance with the devil ‘til there’s no songs left 
I try 
To keep my cool and not let this hate win 
I find 
This mask I wear can’t keep the darkness in 
The world you know was born to fade 
We’ll dance upon its grave 
You don’t know me, you cannot hold me 
You should have guessed that you can’t control me 
I raise my soul like a private army and I steel myself for war 
Because I leaned real young, when you walk through hell 
The devil can’t buy what you won’t sell 
So I took my fear, reshaped and aimed 
Because when the night caves in 
No one will save you 
So we’ll dance with the devil ‘til there’s no songs left 
I try 
To keep my cool and not let this hate win 
I find 
This mask I wear can’t keep the darkness in

Prayer – Sam Smith Lyrics:

I'm young and I'm foolish, I've made bad decisions
I block out the news, turn my back on religion
Don't have no degree, I'm somewhat naive
I've made it this far on my own
But lately, that shit ain't been getting me higher
I lift up my head and the world is on fire
There's dread in my heart and fear in my bones
And I just don't know what to say

Maybe I'll pray, pray
Maybe I'll pray
I've never believed, and you know, but I'm gonna pray

You won't find me in church (no!) reading the bible (no!)
I am still here and I'm still your disciple
I'm down on my knees, I'm begging you please
I'm broken, alone, and afraid
I'm not a saint, I'm more of a sinner
I don't wanna lose, but I fear for the winners
When I try to explain, the words run away
That's why I am stood here today

And I'm gonna pray, pray
Maybe I'll pray, pray for a glimmer of hope
Maybe I'll pray, pray
Maybe I'll pray
I've never believed, and you know that I'm gonna

Won't you call me?
Can we have a one-to-one, please?
Let's talk about freedom
Everyone prays in the end
Everyone prays in the end
Won't you call me?
Can we have a one-to-one, please?
Let's talk about freedom
Everyone prays in the end
Everyone prays in the end

Oh, and I'm gonna pray, I'm gonna pray
I'm gonna pray, pray for a glimmer of hope
Maybe I'll pray, pray
Maybe I'll pray
I've never believed, and you know, but I'm gonna pray",8h--kFui1JA

Lyrics
Keeping thinking that I’m seeing water 
You’re playing tricks on me in the sun 
See your shadow in the courtyard
Stays until the day is done

The desert don’t end
The rain don’t fall 
And I can’t pretend I don’t want you all 
Cos I want you all (you all, you all, you all)

Oh babe I really need you
My feelings getting deeper
My mind is in a free fall
But there’s nothing I can do when it comes to you
You play with my emotions 
I’m flowing like the ocean
I pray for your devotion
Cos there’s nothing I can do when it comes to you 

My oasis 
My oasis
My oasis
There’s nothing I can do when it comes to you

I’m lost on my own (bring me back to life)
I’ve been empty in my soul (bring me back to life)
Promise you won’t let me go 
Say the word and we’ll fly away both fly away now

The desert don’t end
The rain don’t fall 
And I can’t pretend I don’t want you all 
Cos I want you all 

Oh babe I really need you
My feelings getting deeper
My mind is in a free fall
But there’s nothing I can do when it comes to you
You play with my emotions 
I’m flowing like the ocean
I pray for your devotion
Cos there’s nothing I can do when it comes to you 

My oasis 
My oasis
My oasis
There’s nothing I can do when it comes to you

My oasis  
My oasis

There’s nothing I can do when it comes to you

Hey guys!

We contemplated what song we should cover next and decided to go with an old fave that we used to love performing live on tour. This number was on our first ever set list when we did our first show in LA years ago. Loved it then, lovin' it now. 

Also remember to join us for our live streams every monday on Instagram where we sing songs and hang out with you guys. Follow us @jayessleeofficial for updates and snippets!

d5drhWrKAKs,,Pray // Sam Smith ft Logic (Lyrics),Jenn Olivia,,2018-03-29T20:50:26Z,,,,,,,,,,"i really fell in love with this song and i hope you will, too!

lyrics:
they never knew my struggle
rose above the rubble
rather live inside their bubble 
than go through the trouble
of having their double double vision corrected
they just neglect it and

i’ve been thinking lately
will the devil take me?
or will god protect me?
i know i ain’t perfect
but you should respect me
they don’t want me happy
they don’t wanna let me live

i’m young and i’m foolish
i make bad decisions
i block out the news
turn my back on religion
don’t have no degree
i’m somewhat naïve
i have made it this far on my own

but lately that shit ain’t been getting me higher
i lift up my head and the world is on fire
there’s dread in my heart
and fear in my bones
i just don’t know what to say

maybe i’ll pray
pray
maybe i’ll pray
i have never believed in you, no
but i’m gonna pray

i am me
i’m a man
i’m a sinner
but understand
aren’t we all?
so when it comes to passing judgements
i don’t think that you’re the one to make the call
heaven want to cast me out for being me 
i know theres others like me there to break the fall 
i know you hater motherfuckers just can’t relate at all


if i’m the first one to the line that’s fine
i’ll take it all
but logic he gon’ let ‘em know
i ain’t perfect
but i’m worth it
i’m alive
i deserve it
i’ve been praying 
i ain’t playing
i don’t think you hear the words that i’m saying

i don’t think you know the weight on my shoulders
that gets heavier as i get older
calling anybody
calling anybody
can you hear me?
i pray that you hear me
i pray that you hear me

maybe i’ll pray
pray
maybe i’ll pray
i’ve never believed in you, no
but i’m gonna

won’t you call me?
can we have a one on one please?
let’s talk about freedom
everyone prays in the end
everyone prays in the end

oh, won’t you call me?
can we have a one on one please?
let’s talk about freedom
everyone prays in the end
everyone prays in the end

oh, i’m gonna
pray
i’m gonna
pray
i’m gonna
pray
pray for a glimmer of hope
maybe i’ll pray
pray
maybe i’ll pray
i’ve never believed in you, no
but i’m gonna pray",8h--kFui1JA

Written by O. Hawk

Jesus, that’s who it be (that’s the name that saved me)
Jesus, He came for me (when I was down He raised me)
Jesus, Watch over me (protect the spirit inside of me)
Jesus, I’m gonna see (on the day He calls me)

 I’m the biggest sinner that I think the world ever made
 I ain't been right with my life since we had Super Dave
 My prayers are worse than Ben Stiller’s and Kanye West’s
 On my knees praying, thinking God won’t bless this
 The rest is, worst if you look at my struggle
 I was lost in the world; I had no help for my trouble
 Lost in the rubble, ain't nobody saving me now
 When they ask how I’m doing, I was faking a smiling
 Because I was dying in my spirit, I was a FreekieTwinn
 I was running through them girls living my life in sin
 Y'all ain't no about the boy, because I was just that dirty
 I would cover up the smudges, I was just that flirty
 It just hurt me, every time I looked at my past
 Every time the Lord saved me I would put Him last Him
 Never again, because in my life His name comes first
 So I’m always on my knees at the end of the verse

Jesus, that’s who it be (that’s the name that saved me)
Jesus, He came for me (when I was down He raised me)
Jesus, Watch over me (protect the spirit inside of me)
Jesus, I’m gonna see (on the day He calls me)

 Lord you died for me, Lord you cried for me
 To make a better life, Oh Lord you tried for me
 But I wasn’t listening, because I was christening
 Down the road of Hollywood the lights they was glistening
 Camera, action, it’s time for relaxing
 The women looking at me, so it’s time for attraction
 Yeah, I was rapping, but I really wasn’t wrapping
 Truly I was lacking a better satisfaction
 The devil had my mind gone, women had my mind blown
 Music at a standstill, it really had my mind torn
 The devil came after me, but Jesus came back to me
 After I was praying on my knees for Obafemii
 Jesus saved my life dog, the only living Christ dog
 I gave up the sinning, gotta send me a wife dog
 Never will I go back, never will I lose track
 I call on one name, only one name can do that

Jesus, that’s who it be (that’s the name that saved me)
Jesus, He came for me (when I was down He raised me)
Jesus, Watch over me (protect the spirit inside of me)
Jesus, I’m gonna see (on the day He calls me)

 1st He saved me, 2nd He raised me,
 3rd gave His life on the cross, am I crazy
 To keep one sinning, and keep on living
 I keep on sinning, but He keep on forgiving
 And man that crazy, because I ain't even worth it
 Why I feel the pain when my mom had to birth it
 Naw I ain't perfect, but he had to work wit me
 In a circuit, when u come around you’ll see
 That I changed, and only because His name
 I was washed in the blood, so I’ll never be the same
 Almost killed by a firearm, ducking from that fellow armed
 Late night all alone, praying for the Lord to come
 Bullets grazed by my head, thought I was already dead
 Called on the name of Jesus, and this is what He said
 You need to change your ways, you need to learn to pray
 That’s why I’m on my knees, that why I always say

AGXDUQC5ABY,,"""Maybe I Need More Time For Regrowth"" - HUGE Mistake!",Perfect Hair Health,,2021-05-06T15:39:22Z,,,,,,,,,,"//Get A Free Course On Achieving Hair Regrowth, With or Without Drugs//
https://perfecthairhealth.com/email-course/

Have you ever heard of the term, ""Results Horizons?"" It's a way to describe the time window for when a hair loss treatment should start working... and when new results become unlikely.

When I first started losing my hair, I knew nothing about Results Horizons. Consequently, I used minoxidil for six years without seeing any regrowth... all the while, thinking, ""Maybe I just need more time to see results.""

This line of thinking is dangerous, and it's something I see all the time in my video consultations. So, I wanted to make a video revealing the Results Horizons for popular hair loss interventions, all based on the available clinical data: massaging, microneedling, finasteride, minoxidil, and more. This way, you'll never quit a treatment too early, or commit to something that isn't working for too long.

Note: this video is leaked from our membership community. It is part one of a four-part series uncovering the biggest treatment mistakes hair loss sufferers make. The next three videos will be published inside the membership, and will be accessible to members only.

You said this would be the very last time
I'll be seeing you
'Cause you don't even wanna talk
And you don't even wanna meet up, up
You don't even wanna be friends
Pretend you like me, ooh, oh, oh
I take time for love
It's right, your love takes hold of you
Take time for love, babe
And try my best to explain, yeah
But I had to throw it all away, why?

I said I love you, baby
And, I, I gave your love away
I said I love you, baby
And, I gave it, I gave your love away
I said I love you, baby
And, I, I gave your love away
I said I love you, baby
And, I, I gave your love away

I gave your love away
I gave your love away
I gave your love away
No, no, no, no, no

I'm in the courtyard of your mansion in Westlake
Feelin' a way about today, weather grey
Jacket on, movin' along, checkin' my phone
Thought I heard you call, I was wrong
Why has it been so long, why?

I said I love you, baby
And, I, I gave your love away
I said I love you, baby
And, I gave it, I gave your love away
I said I love you, baby
And, I gave it, I gave your love away
I said I love you, baby
And, I, I gave your love away

I gave your love away
I gave your love away
I gave your love away
I gave your love away
No, no, no, no, no
I had to give up, yeah I had to give up
I gave your love away
I gave your love away
I gave your love away
I gave your love away
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
(Take time for love)
That's what you said to me
Take time for love, make time for
Make time for love, take time for love
So I know that we can be something

Lyrics: 
You ain’t ever afraid to be by yourself
You ain’t ever afraid to be by yourself
Say you ain’t afraid to be by yourself
Say you ain’t afraid to be by yourself
You don’t need a man you do it by yourself
You did it by yourself

Well is you single, where my single ladies
Stack your bread and bought your own Mercedes
You your own boss do it your way
Quick to tell a broke n****a go away
You ain’t never bout no drama
You ain’t pressed
You want bigger things and better things
Put that work in stay on your job, you don’t break a sweat
In the mirror taking pics cause you know you the shit
 
You ain’t ever afraid to be by yourself
You ain’t ever afraid to be by yourself
Say you ain’t afraid to be by yourself
Say you ain’t afraid to be by yourself
You don’t need a man you do it by yourself
You did it by yourself

Yes, you did it by yourself, by yourself
Sneaked into the bag, but you know I got plans to spend my money on you
But you got your own girl
Yeah, that’s what I admire
She in for the week, she like need I remind you
I’m busy on the weekends, free for tonight
If you’re free for the night, then keep me in mind, baby
You should be right here with me, babe
No, you don’t need me babe

You ain’t ever afraid to be by yourself
You ain’t ever afraid to be by yourself
Say you ain’t afraid to be by yourself
Say you ain’t afraid to be by yourself
You don’t need a man you do it by yourself
You did it by yourself

Yeah, you know I do this shit on my own
Pockets long, I’m so grown, I’m so godly
Even when I’m alone, I’m never lonely
Only call him up when I am horny
Yeah I’m that bitch and I know it
And I don’t even need nobody else to notice
I be ridin through the hood up bumpin my own shit
Headed to the crib right by the ocean
Yeah, I did it, I did it, I do it all by myself (yeah)
I get it, I get it, don’t need nobody else
 
You ain’t ever afraid to be by yourself
You ain’t ever afraid to be by yourself
Say you ain’t afraid to be by yourself
Say you ain’t afraid to be by yourself
You don’t need a man you do it by yourself
You did it by yourself

Lyrics: 
Who tryna who tryna go
Who gon drop it down like there’s money on the floor
Who tryna who tryna buss it for the dollas
Who tryna freak bring the home girl and run it
She my spicy lil mama she let me bust her piñata
I buy her all the designer but she’s still leaving tomorrow
 
Who tryna who tryna go
Who n***a hope that she don’t
Who tryna slide for the night
Who tryna wife her? Not I 
Say my name say my name
Yellow diamonds on my chain, lemonade
I could never be your main but tell your main
You gon have to call him back another time
Girl let’s get out and ride
Go up, get loud
 Yea right here and now
 
Yeah tell me who tryna who tryna go
Who gon drop it down like there’s money on the floor
Who tryna who tryna buss it for the dollas
Who tryna freak bring the home girl and run it
She my spicy lil mama she let me bust her piñata
I buy her all the designer but she’s still leavin tomorrow
 
She tryna pull my pants down
I was lighting up a stoge on my break time
Told her babe I gotta meeting over FaceTime
She don’t care my lil mama never waste time
Ooh, gotta catch a flight real quick 
Sneak xanny on the plane in her fucking lipstick
She look at me and laugh give a fuck what I think
And she bat shit crazy but I like it like this
Shawty so bad man shawty so cold
Wanna go wild 25 years old
Met her in the club they were playing Psycho 
Now we match AP’s and they all rose gold
And we both can agree
Ooh she wilder than me
 
Yeah, tell me who tryna who tryna go
Who gon drop it down like there’s money on the floor
Who tryna who tryna buss it for the dollas
Who tryna freak bring the home girl and run it
She my spicy lil mama she let me bust her piñata
I buy her all the designer but she’s still leavin tomorrow

Lyrics: 
You ain’t ever afraid to be by yourself
You ain’t ever afraid to be by yourself
Say you ain’t afraid to be by yourself
Say you ain’t afraid to be by yourself
You don’t need a man you do it by yourself
You did it by yourself

Well is you single, where my single ladies
Stack your bread and bought your own Mercedes
You your own boss do it your way
Quick to tell a broke n****a go away
You ain’t never bout no drama
You ain’t pressed
You want bigger things and better things
Put that work in stay on your job, you don’t break a sweat
In the mirror taking pics cause you know you the shit
 
You ain’t ever afraid to be by yourself
You ain’t ever afraid to be by yourself
Say you ain’t afraid to be by yourself
Say you ain’t afraid to be by yourself
You don’t need a man you do it by yourself
You did it by yourself

Yes, you did it by yourself, by yourself
Sneaked into the bag, but you know I got plans to spend my money on you
But you got your own girl
Yeah, that’s what I admire
She in for the week, she like need I remind you
I’m busy on the weekends, free for tonight
If you’re free for the night, then keep me in mind, baby
You should be right here with me, babe
No, you don’t need me babe

You ain’t ever afraid to be by yourself
You ain’t ever afraid to be by yourself
Say you ain’t afraid to be by yourself
Say you ain’t afraid to be by yourself
You don’t need a man you do it by yourself
You did it by yourself

Yeah, you know I do this shit on my own
Pockets long, I’m so grown, I’m so godly
Even when I’m alone, I’m never lonely
Only call him up when I am horny
Yeah I’m that bitch and I know it
And I don’t even need nobody else to notice
I be ridin through the hood up bumpin my own shit
Headed to the crib right by the ocean
Yeah, I did it, I did it, I do it all by myself (yeah)
I get it, I get it, don’t need nobody else
 
You ain’t ever afraid to be by yourself
You ain’t ever afraid to be by yourself
Say you ain’t afraid to be by yourself
Say you ain’t afraid to be by yourself
You don’t need a man you do it by yourself
You did it by yourself

""Eminem wins by a knockout!"" raves Rolling Stone, as the Grammy Award-winning phenomenon makes his feature film debut in this gripping story about the boundaries that hold us back - and the courage that can set us free. For Jimmy Smith, Jr. (Eminem), life is a daily fight just to keep hope alive. Feeding his dreams in Detroit's vibrant music scene, Jimmy wages an extraordinary personal struggle to find his own voice - and earn a place in a world where rhymes rule, legends are born and every moment… is another chance. From Academy Award winner Curtis Hanson (L.A. Confidential) and Oscar-winning producer Brian Grazer (A Beautiful Mind), 8 Mile is the triumphant film Time Magazine hails as ""Powerful!"" and Entertainment Weekly applauds as ""Electrifying and Mesmerizing!""

BGAAJkmlM8E,,Hidden Meanings Behind J. Cole's 'Middle Child' Video Explained,Insider,,2019-02-26T17:52:20Z,,,,,,,,,,"J. Cole released the much anticipated music video to his song, “Middle Child."" We look at all the hidden meanings, Easter eggs, and references that even the biggest hip hop fans might have missed. 

In the video he seems to reference the fact that he's yet to win a Grammy and that he's awkwardly stuck between two hip hop generations. He also appears to tackle the topic of cultural appropriation of black people and artists. What might be most interesting is that the video might be referencing his past beef rapper L'il Pump.

The video shows that while Cole is continuously overlooked in the music industry, the rapper is still a quiet but deadly hunter. In the video, he puts rappers' heads on a mantle, and shows a white woman literally shopping for a black woman's face. Here’s a breakdown of all things you may have missed in the rapper’s newest video.

Action movies like ""John Wick"" and ""Hobbs & Shaw"" wowed audiences with their audacious stunts, while ""Missing Link"" employed classic stop-motion animation techniques, and ""Toy Story 4"" used technological breakthroughs to make Pixar's computer animation better than ever. Meanwhile, the CGI in ""The Lion King"" was so real, you might be fooled into thinking you were watching a live-action movie.

Some of the greatest scenes in history are largely thanks to the actor's ability to conjure real tears. However, sometimes they need help. That's where the makeup department comes in.

dO5SA74hsHc,,Childish Gambino’s 3005 Video FINALLY Explained,Dissect Podcast,,2020-10-06T20:51:21Z,,,,,,,,,,"Dissect unpacks the meaning behind Childish Gambino's 3005 music video. Far from a simple love song, 3005 expresses Gambino's existential loneliness on display throughout the world of Because The Internet. Through the video's use of a few key symbols (a decaying teddy bear, ferris wheel) and a unique looping structure, Donald Glover questions our so-called solutions to the existential threats of the world. Finally, we compare 3005 and This Is America, and how Glover uses the same visual technique to convey a similar overall message.

This video is a part of the Dissect Podcast's 13 episode season analyzing the music, lyrics, and meaning of Because The Internet by Childish Gambino. Listen on Spotify (https://spoti.fi/3jPWuWI) or wherever you get your podcasts.

XW2gykU7C2o,,Where Hollywood Shoots All Its Plane Scenes | Movies Insider,Insider,,2019-03-13T14:31:54Z,,,,,,,,,,"Many of the most iconic plane and airport scenes were filmed in the same place — Air Hollywood, the LA production studio entirely dedicated to aviation. We take you behind the scenes of their sets to see how they created famous scenes in movies like “Bridesmaids,” “Wolf of Wall Street,” and “Kill Bill,” and in TV shows like “Brooklyn Nine-Nine,” “The Office,” “Grey’s Anatomy,” “Silicon Valley,” and “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.”  

Air Hollywood was also behind some of the famous plane crash sequence in “Lost.” Plus, they’ve provided the sets for music videos by artists like The Weeknd and Pitbull.   

As the biggest aviation-themed studio in the world, Air Hollywood has three full aircraft interiors and an airport terminal set that’s reconfigurable into any part of the air travel experience. They’re equipped with a huge warehouse of props and costumes from different decades and can easily switch out their seats, signs, and parts to replicate different eras, settings, and memorabilia from different decades.  

Their realistic production design has drawn some of TV’s and Hollywood’s biggest directors and producers, including Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino, Steven Spielberg, J.J. Abrams, Mindy Kaling, and Shonda Rhimes.

Dyer breaks down ""Heat"" (1995), ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" (2012), ""The Dark Knight"" (2008), ""Cherry"" (2021), ""Den of Thieves"" (2018), ""Dog Day Afternoon"" (1975), ""Baby Driver"" (2017), ""Out of Sight"" (1998), ""Money Heist"" (2017), ""The Town"" (2010), and ""Inside Man"" (2006).

Dyer served in the United States Marine Corps. He turned to bank robbery after threats to his family by a Mexican cartel. He was nicknamed the ""kangaroo bandit,"" having been captured on CCTV stuffing cash into a backpack worn on his chest. He says he robbed over 100 banks across California between 1999 and 2001. He eventually turned himself in and served nine years in prison after pleading guilty to six robberies. He now works as a life coach and motivational speaker, helping newly released prisoners reintegrate into society. He's also a partner in two production companies.

Hands Across America Philadelphia image by Sam Cali https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hands_Across_America_Philadelphia.jpg

After sending shockwaves across contemporary culture and setting a new standard for provocative, socially-conscious horror films with his directorial debut, Get Out, Academy Award®-winning visionary Jordan Peele returns with another original nightmare that he has written, directed and produced. Set in present day along the iconic Northern California coastline, Us, from Monkeypaw Productions, stars Oscar® winner Lupita Nyong’o as Adelaide Wilson, a woman returning to her beachside childhood home with her husband, Gabe (Black Panther’s Winston Duke), and their two children (Shahadi Wright Joseph, Evan Alex) for an idyllic summer getaway.

Haunted by an unexplainable and unresolved trauma from her past and compounded by a string of eerie coincidences, Adelaide feels her paranoia elevate to high-alert as she grows increasingly certain that something bad is going to befall her family. After spending a tense beach day with their friends, the Tylers (Emmy winner Elisabeth Moss, Tim Heidecker, Cali Sheldon, Noelle Sheldon), Adelaide and her family return to their vacation home. When darkness falls, the Wilsons discover the silhouette of four figures holding hands as they stand in the driveway. Us pits an endearing American family against a terrifying and uncanny opponent: doppelgängers of themselves. Writer and director Peele produces for his Monkeypaw Productions alongside Sean McKittrick, Jason Blum, and Monkeypaw’s Ian Cooper. Us will be released by Universal Pictures this March, 2019.

Directed By Jordan Peele
Produced By Jason Blum, Sean McKittrick, Jordan Peele, Ian Cooper
Executive Produced By Daniel Lupi, Bea Sequeira

DfOWIyZUCq0,,"The Ending Of Jordan Peele’s New Movie ‘Us,’ Explained",Insider,,2019-03-22T17:26:10Z,,,,,,,,,,"There’s a lot to unpack in the ending of “Us” — the second horror film from writer-director Jordan Peele, following his 2017 box-office hit “Get Out.” Here’s everything important that you might’ve missed at the end of the film — and our analysis of what the Big Twist really means. Be warned: There are some serious spoilers ahead.

“Us” puts a terrifying spin on the doppelgänger concept, and it’s full of social and political messaging in typical Peele-ian style. We break down the symbolism and hidden meanings,along with all the clever references Peele slipped into the film (what was with all those rabbits?). Plus, our explanation of how “Us” ties in to “Get Out.”

The cast of “Us” includes “Black Panther” co-stars Lupita Nyong’o and Winston Duke alongside Elisabeth Moss (“Handmaid’s Tale”) and Tim Heidecker (“Tim and Eric”). Nyong’o and Duke play Adelaide and Gabe Wilson, a married couple with two children (played by Shahadii Wright Joseph and Evan Alex). On a beach vacation in Santa Cruz, the four Wilsons find themselves under siege by a family of scissors-wielding invaders — who happen to look exactly like them. The night descends into chaos from there.

It’s all set to an unsettling soundtrack, which features a creepy reworking of Luniz’s “I Got 5 On It.” Other highlights include tracks from Janelle Monáe, The Beach Boys, and NWA.

“Us” is out in theaters now.

zV2ICC2h74s,,Why Are There So Many Movie Theater Formats? | Movies Insider,Insider,,2019-07-10T21:19:29Z,,,,,,,,,,"Between Dolby Cinemas, IMAX, RealD 3D, and Regal RPX there are a lot of ways to watch a movie. And some movies like The Lion King are released in all of them. But which of these premium formats is better? Well, it depends on you and on the movie. If you want the biggest screen size you can get, you want IMAX. But if you're an audiophile you'll love Dolby Atmos. And different genres lend themselves to different formats. A comedy is probably fine in standard/digital. But if you're seeing a big blockbuster you might want a format like IMAX or Dolby Cinema.

Lyrics:
Lost on the freeway 
Well, This must be LA
Tired and lonely
With no real place to stay
Is this the future
And where I wanna be?
Last night it hit me
When I had this crazy dream

Of waking up
In your house
On a san Francisco St
We tune out all the nasty weather
And it's all in front of you and me

You were intriguing
Just looking at a magazine
like when I first saw you
Back in two-oo thousand and three
And then you walked over
said: 'you don't have to be alone.'
I don't have a crystal ball...
there's no way I could have known

(id be) waking up
In your house
On a san Francisco St
We tune out all the nasty weather
And it's all in front of you and me
waking up
In your house
On a san Francisco St
We tune out all the nasty weather
And it's all in front of you and me",2PH7dK6SLC8

Lyrics

Wandering the streets all through the night,
Searching for the one to make me right.
Wondering if she's the shade of you,
And If so, should I try to see it through.

Darling, I got my trust issues.
Warning, you stay away.
If we meet at the rendezvous,
take me away, Sunray

Time and toys,
May fill my heart with joy,
I'll know peace when I'm your lover boy.

I'll be your new school soul.
Silver and gold.
New desire.
Friends on fire.
Call me 'lover boy'",2PH7dK6SLC8

John Mayer
“New Light”

I’m the boy in your other phone
Lighting up inside your drawer at home all alone
Pushin 40 in the friend zone
We talk and then you walk away every day
Oh you don’t think twice bout me
And maybe you’re right to doubt me but
But if you give me just one night
You’re gonna see me in a new light
Yeah if you give me just one night
To meet you underneath the moonlight

Oh I want a take two
I wanna break through
I wanna know the real thing about you
So I can see you in a new light

Take a ride up to Malibu
I just wanna sit and look at you, look at you
What would it matter if your friends knew
Who cares what other people say anyway
Oh we can go far from here
And make a new world together babe

‘Cause if you give me just one night
You’re gonna see me in a new light
Yeah, if you give me just one night
To meet you underneath the moonlight

Oh I want a take two
I wanna break through
I wanna know the real thing about you
So I can see you in a new light

Yeah if you give me just one night
You’re gonna see me in a new light
Yeah if you give me just one night
To meet you underneath the moonlight

What do I do with all this, what do I do with all this
Love that's runnin through my veins for you
What do I do with all this, what do I do with all this
Love that's runnin through my veins for you
What do I do with all this, what do I do with all this
Love that's runnin through my veins for you
What do I do with all this, what do I do with all this

I do not own the song used in this video and it is used for entertainment purposes.

LYRICS

when i'm furthest from myself   •far away•
feeling closer to the stars   •outer space•
i've been invaded by the dark   •can't escape•
trying to recognize myself when i feel i've been replaced

i can feel a kick down in my soul
and its pulling me back to earth to let me know
i am not a slave, cant be contained
so pick me from the dark and pull me from the grave

'cause

i still feel alive
when it is hopeless, i start to notice
that i still feel alive
falling forward back into orbit

so when i lose my gravity in this sleepy womb
drifting as i dream, but i'll wake up soon
to realize the hand of life is reaching out
to rid me of my pride i call allegiance to myself

i can feel a kick down in my soul
it's pulling me back to earth to let me know
and this heart that beats inside of me will show
it will show

floating in outer space,  have i misplaced a part of my soul?
lost in the in between,  or so it seems,  i'm out of control
floating in outer space,   have i misplaced a part of my soul
lost in the in between but i cant keep me asleep for long 

'cause

i still feel alive   •i can feel it• 
when it is hopeless   •it ain't hopeless•
i start to notice   •start to notice•
i still feel alive   •i can feel it• 
falling forward   •falling forward•
back into orbit   •yeah•

Young and full of running
Tell me where's that taking me?
Just a great figure 8 or a tiny infinity

Love is really nothing
But a dream that keeps waking me
For all of my trying
You still end up dying
How can it be?

Don't say a word, just come over and lie here with me
'Cause I'm just about to set fire to everything I see
I want you so bad I'll go back on the things I believe
There I just said it, I'm scared you'll forget about me

So young and full of running, all the way to the edge of desire
Steady my breathing, silently screaming,
""I have to have you now""
Wired and I'm tired
Think I'll sleep in my clothes on the floor
Maybe this mattress will spin on its axis and find me on yours

Don't say a word just come over and lie here with me
'Cause I'm just about to set fire to everything I see
I want you so bad I'll go back on the things I believe
There I just said it, I'm scared you'll forget about me

Don't say a word just come over and lie here with me

Lyrics:
Even in the darkest hour
You don't have to search so hard
You’re the one that holds the power
Now’s the time to play your part
 
If you could see your true colours
You wouldn’t have to try so hard
Hiding under all these covers
We all work the way we are

It’s the same with me and you and everybody
All hold tight our breath while waiting for the party

So many doors
So many closed to us
Oh baby my heart's open
You know that I stay open

Lost in the night
Standing outside the club
Oh baby my heart's open
You know that I stay open for you

Baby I can read the stars
And I see how they shine for you
Don't cave yourself up in the darkness
So many better things to do

Wish you could see your true colours
Don’t be afraid to play your cards
The sky is open you should follow
We all work the way we are

It’s the same with me and you and everybody
All hold tight our breath while waiting for the party

So many doors
So many closed to us
Oh baby my heart's open
You know that I stay open

Lost in the night
Standing outside the club
Oh baby my heart's open
You know that I stay open for you

It’s the same with me and you and everybody
All hold tight our breath while waiting for the party

It’s the same with me and you and everybody
All hold tight our breath while waiting for the party
So many doors
So many closed to us
Oh baby my heart's open
You know that I stay open
Lost in the night
Standing outside the club
Oh baby my heart's open
You know that I stay open for you

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Sometimes I just can't take it
Sometimes I just can't take it
And it isn't alright
I'm not going to make it
And I think my shoe is untied
I'm like a broken record
I'm like a broken record
And I'm not playing right
Just wanna go up higher, can we?
Till you tell me I'm a heavenly photo

[Pre Chorus]
Hold tight (hold tight)
Come on (come on)
Come on (come on)
Woah
Come on (come on)
Come on (come on)
Don't let go
Hold tight (hold tight)
Hold tight (hold tight)
Woah
It's alright, it's alright
You said
Woah
It's alright, it's alright
You said
I've got my hands up, shaking just to let you know

[Chorus]
That you've got a higher power
Got me singing every second
Dancing every hour
Oh, yeah
You'vе got a higher power
And you're rеally someone
I want to know
Oh!

[Verse 2]
This boy is electric (ooh)
This boy is electric and you're sparkling like
The universe connected
And I'm buzzing
Night after night after night
This joy is electric
This joy is electric and you're circuiting through
I'm so happy that I'm alive
Happy I'm alive at the same time as you

[Chorus]
'Cause you've got a higher power
Got me singing every second
Dancing every hour
Oh, yeah
You've got a higher power
And you're really someone
I want to know
Oh!
(I wanna know, oh!)

[Bridge]
You've got
Yeah you've got a higher

My hands up, shaking just to let you know that

[Chorus]
You've got a higher power
Got me singing every second
Dancing every hour
Oh, yeah
You've got a higher power

[Outro]
Once in a lifetime
I'm going a million miles an hour
And for so long
I've been down on my knees
To your love song
Floats me over and over
For so long
I've been down on my knees
To your love song
Floats me oh
Oh

When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?

And, darling, I will be loving you 'til we're 70
And, baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me—I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So, honey, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way (mmm...)
I know you will still love me the same

'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And, baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

That, baby, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
Thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are (oh, oh)

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, lo-ud

So, baby, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh, darling, place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
But maybe we found love right where we are
Oh, baby, we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are",2PH7dK6SLC8

Special Thanks to Live Nation and the beautiful Wiltern Theatre! 

Don’t let his larger-than-life presence fool you. Jake Hoot may stand 6’6”, but the Season 17 Champion of NBC’s “The Voice” is just as genuine and sweet natured as ever. His dynamic storytelling abilities and powerful vocals led to an unprecedented run on the Emmy-award winning talent series. Shattering records left and right, Hoot’s chart-topping abilities landed him a record 6 songs in the Top 10 of the iTunes Country Singles Chart as well as a #1 song on the overall iTunes Singles Chart. With the release of his most recent single, “Dangerous Thing” the country crooner is solidifying his sound and ‘creating something familiar yet fresh for fans of different styles or eras of country music.’ (Wide Open Country)

The Team Kelly Clarkson contestant amassed a fiercely loyal following during his time on the show thanks to his authentic delivery of straight-from-the-soul music. Much of this and his sincere humility could be attributed to his unique and adventurous life growing up as the 2nd of 9 siblings to Baptist Missionary parents. Born in Texas, Hoot led quite the gypsy childhood having lived in Oklahoma, Haiti, and an 11-year stint in the Dominican Republic where he first learned to play guitar. Fluent in Spanish, Hoot credits his diverse musical influence to his time on the island. The singer/songwriter relocated to Tennessee at 20-years-old where he began gigging and attended Tennessee Tech University as a walk-on football player.  

There is no denying that Hoot has a heart of a philanthropist and gives back as much as possible. During his stint on The Voice, Hoot created a charitable merchandise line and was able to donate more than $15,000 to local organizations in his hometown of Cookeville, TN. Following the deadly tornadoes that hit Middle, Tennessee on March 3rd, Hoot released an uplifting song entitled “Tennessee Strong” which reached Top 10 in the iTunes Country Singles chart with and Top 35 on the iTunes All-Genre Chart. All proceeds from the streams and downloads of the track benefit Tornado survivors. 

Currently amassing over 3.5 million Apple Music and Spotify streams, nearly 75K downloads and celebrating his second performance at the Grand Ole Opry, the future proves promising for this mega-talent with a heart of gold who is known by his 5-year old daughter simply as “Daddy.”

S1XtMT9ER0o,,"""Little Girl"" by Christina Grimmie (OFFICIAL VIDEO)",zeldaxlove64 Christina Grimmie,,2018-05-09T07:48:21Z,,,,,,,,,,"Released on May 11, 2018 on all major music platforms: https://ffm.to/littlegirl.OYD

Little Girl is an original, never released song by Christina Grimmie that shares a moving story about the profound level of love and support that exists between mother and daughter. Christina began writing this song at age 12 and later finished it after moving to California. It was a tribute to her mother, Tina Grimmie, created to comfort her during breast cancer treatment. 

The phrase “little girl” was used frequently by Tina to comfort Christina as a young girl when she was afraid. The irony of the song is that Christina speaks these words back to her mother at a critical and difficult time in her life, following her loss and current battle with cancer. This song was held personally by Tina (aka Mama Grimmie) because it was something special between her and Christina. Tina has decided to share this personal message to encourage mothers and daughters worldwide.

By the way, I started trading on Binance (the first crypto exchange with a turnover of several billion $ a day!). I'm sure almost everyone is aware that Bitcoin has grown up a lot over the past year.
For starters, you can go to crypto sites: Coingecko or Coinmarketcap and just watch the charts, how the price changes over the course of the week. 
For example, Dogecoin, on April 8, 2021, cost 0.06 cents, April 16 it already cost 0.45 cents! May 4-0.51C, May 5 cost 0.69 cents!  He'll write just one tweet and it will take off by 20%. 
Signing up is as easy as on any social network and with my link JOLT7GZF, you'll receive a 20% discount on each deal.

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Sometimes I just can't take it
Sometimes I just can't take it
And it isn't alright
I'm not going to make it
And I think my shoe is untied
I'm like a broken record
I'm like a broken record
And I'm not playing right
Just wanna go up higher, can we?
Till you tell me I'm a heavenly photo

[Pre Chorus]
Hold tight (hold tight)
Come on (come on)
Come on (come on)
Woah
Come on (come on)
Come on (come on)
Don't let go
Hold tight (hold tight)
Hold tight (hold tight)
Woah
It's alright, it's alright
You said
Woah
It's alright, it's alright
You said
I've got my hands up, shaking just to let you know

[Chorus]
That you've got a higher power
Got me singing every second
Dancing every hour
Oh, yeah
You'vе got a higher power
And you're rеally someone
I want to know
Oh!

[Verse 2]
This boy is electric (ooh)
This boy is electric and you're sparkling like
The universe connected
And I'm buzzing
Night after night after night
This joy is electric
This joy is electric and you're circuiting through
I'm so happy that I'm alive
Happy I'm alive at the same time as you

[Chorus]
'Cause you've got a higher power
Got me singing every second
Dancing every hour
Oh, yeah
You've got a higher power
And you're really someone
I want to know
Oh!
(I wanna know, oh!)

[Bridge]
You've got
Yeah you've got a higher
You've got
Yeah you've got a higher
You've got
Yeah you've got a higher
You've got
Oh
You've got
Oh you've got a higher
You've got
Yeah you've got a higher
You've got
Oh you've got a higher
My hands up, shaking just to let you know that

[Chorus]
You've got a higher power
Got me singing every second
Dancing every hour
Oh, yeah
You've got a higher power

[Outro]
Once in a lifetime
I'm going a million miles an hour
And for so long
I've been down on my knees
To your love song
Floats me over and over
For so long
I've been down on my knees
To your love song
Floats me oh
Oh

U ktibtha bi tbissima  
Fir-rima ser insemmik 
Ħa tkun taf kemm sirt naħseb fik x2 
Ħa tkun taf kemm sirt naħseb   

Jekk nimxu b’passi bħal tal-iljun  
Int l-ilma ġieri u jien il-vapur 
M’hemmx ħin mitluf  
Bik nagħlaq it-truf  
Ser ngħix, ħa nixgħel u mmut 
Mad-dija  
Xħin negħlbu l-mistħija  
Hawn mimli mħabba u tbatija  
Ċans wieħed biss illejla   

Ser inkun qed nistenniek 
Kull sekonda naraha ġurnata  
Indur ma nafx x’ser insib 
Ħares dritt f’għajnejja 
Ħsibt f’dil-melodija  
U ktibtha bi tbissima  
Fir-rima ser insemmik 
Ħa tkun taf kemm sirt naħseb fik x2 
Ħa tkun taf kemm sirt naħseb

LYRICS:
(Verse 1)
I know you wanna ride
see it behind your pride
this ain't hide and go seek
why you still tryna hide
You know I wanna ride
but you gotta teach me how
at times I get a little shy
cause I wanna make you proud

We don't need no strings attached
so put your feelings to the side and
let's get down
(baby lets make shit shake)

Fulfilling yo needs, I'm the definition
got yo legs behind yo head, favorite position
we don't need no frustrations, so all expectations
drop 'em, when we hit the bed, only feelings is vibrations

(PRE-HOOK)
We don't need titles boy we can have fun
come give it to me, promise I won't run
I'm a good girl but for you I'll act up
No feelings involved but you might fall in love

(HOOK)
OH, its what you're doing to me, got my body
feeling right, no come and drown in my sea
kiss yo body, lick yo body (yeah, yeah)
climb on top you can ride it

Ooh, my body grinding on (your body)
While you riding on (my body)
And we ain’t gotta tell (nobody)
Nobody, gone do ya body like me

(Verse 2)
I want you to bend me over and take control
Of it, put your back into it, when you stroking it
Damn you got a mouth, but can you use that 
Mouth for dirty things, and without no strings

We don't need no strings attached
so put your feelings to the side and
let's get down
(baby lets make shit shake)

Fulfilling yo needs, I'm the definition
got yo legs behind yo head, favorite position
we don't need no frustrations, so all expectations
drop 'em, when we hit the bed, only feelings is vibrations

(PRE-HOOK)
We don't need titles boy we can have fun
come give it to me, promise I won't run
I'm a good girl but for you I'll act up
No feelings involved but you might fall in love

(HOOK)
OH, its what you're doing to me, got my body
feeling right, no come and drown in my sea
kiss yo body, lick yo body (yeah, yeah)
climb on top you can ride it

Ooh, my body grinding on (your body)
While you riding on (my body)
And we ain’t gotta tell (nobody)
Nobody, gone do ya body like me

(VERSE 3) 
I wanna ride so come inside I’m 
Bust it baby with no plies 
I’m gonna make you feel so proud 
You just might wanna make me wife

Imma pull up just drop yo addy, 
Imma make you call me daddy 
Turn a good girl into a savage 
Say the word and you can have it

(HOOK)
Ooh, my body grinding on (your body)
While you riding on (my body)
And we ain’t gotta tell (nobody)
Nobody, gone do ya body like me

My homies ain’t selling me out 
I Blocked yo gram, and your Snapchat
So how the f*** you gone find out. 
Come in at 6 in the morning, 
When I’m done, when I’m done 
Fucking w/ all of these bitches, 
Being dumb being dumb. Because
Yo intuition never lie
So why I’m steady tryna hide
How’d you get them screenshots
Thought I had’em deleted that night
I been creeping and freaking and thinking that I’ll never lose you
All these tens and they bad and they texting my phone
So what if you through

Pre Hook - Thought I was winning but losing, 
Made you feel dumb for accusing
I know my love was confusing 
But Who did I think I was fooling 
So guess what I, I think u should do, give me a taste of my own medicine. 

Hook - I wouldn’t like it if you did the things I do, put me on do not disturb and entertain these dudes
Gone and ride him crazy, it ain’t nothing I can do
Gave all of these girls everything that belongs to you
So Gone and call up Bryan, I ain’t mad at Ryan, when u text Lorenzo, i might end up crying

I had it twisted, two can play this game too, No I don’t like it but I did the same to you, same to you yeah

[Chorus: Ar'mon]
You ain't gotta question this
Shawty, I'ma always ride out
Even when we passionate
Shawty, I'm yours, your mine now
This is (forever), got me (forever)
Got you (forever, forever), always (forever, forever, ay)
You can have all of mine
Baby, you can have all my time now
I just wanna see you shine
Girl, you're like a perfect diamond
This is (forever), got me (forever)
Got you (forever), always (forever, forever)

[Verse 1: Ar'mon]
Baby, they don't shine like you
Baby, they don't shine like you
One in a million, you the goat
And I don't want nobody but you
Hidden treasure that I found ya
I'ma run it up with ya momma
I'ma take my time, slow grind ya
I'ma make sure these hoes never get out of line

[Pre-Chorus: Ar'mon]
Girl, you at the top of my list
Kissing both sets of your lips
Taste like honey, I must admit, yeah
Oh, girl, this thing is on fire
Your love be taking me higher
Look at the song you inspired

[Chorus: Ar'mon & Trey]
You ain't gotta question this
Shawty, I'ma always ride out
Even when we passionate
Shawty, I'm yours, your mine now
This is (forever), got me (forever)
Got you (forever, forever), always (forever, forever, ay)
You can have all of mine
Baby, you can have all my time now
I just wanna see you shine
Girl, you're like a perfect diamond
This is (forever), got me (forever)
Got you (forever), always (forever, forever)

[Verse 2: Trey]
Forever and ever
And ever and ever and ever
We stronger, we storm through the weather
We building, we on a new level
I'm digging, you ain't talkin' shovels
Get closer to your plane or shuttle
I'm by your side any battle
And I don't even need a medal
You send me swinging
This a special kind of vibe it don't finish
Baby, tell me what you like, you gon' get it
Worth more than silver and gold
I'm never lettin' you go
Girl, I just thought you should know

[Chorus: Ar'mon & Trey]
You ain't gotta question this
Shawty, I'ma always ride out
Even when we passionate
Shawty, I'm yours, your mine now
This is (forever), got me (forever)
Got you (forever, forever), always (forever, forever, ay)
You can have all of mine
Baby, you can have all my time now
I just wanna see you shine
Girl, you're like a perfect diamond
This is (forever), got me (forever)
Got you (forever), always (forever, forever)

Aye Townies, ya boys are writing to you from Vegas right now! We’re so excited to be here, but of course it wouldn’t be Friday without posting a video for you guys and we didn’t forget. This week we covered Love Lies by Khalid and Normani. The friendship between Normani and Khalid is so real and we really love the vibe they create together, and that’s why we chose this song. Tell us what you think in the comments. Also, we’re taking suggestions for next week’s video so if you have any, let us know!

Lyrics:

If you’re down, don’t hide it
Feelin’ me you don’t gotta deny it
Baby, you gon’ make me overnight it
Baby, are you down?
If you’re down, don’t hide it
Feelin’ me you don’t gotta deny it
Baby, you gon’ make me overnight it
Baby, are you down?

Sorry if it's hard to catch my vibe, yeah
I need a lover to trust, tell me you're on my side
Are you down for the ride?
It's not easy for someone to catch my eye
But I've been waitin' for you for my whole damn life
For my whole lifetime

Don't be afraid to tell me if you ain't with it 
I see you're focused, yeah you're so independent 
It's hard for me to open up, I'll admit it 
You've got some shit to say and I'm here to listen

So baby, tell me where your love lies
Waste the day and spend the night
Underneath the sunrise
Show me where your love lies

I've been so into your mystery
Is it because of our history?
Are you into me?
When it feels so good, but it's bad for you
Can't say I don't want it 'cause I know I do
Come on over, I need your company
Cravin' that synergy

Don't be afraid to tell me if you ain't with it 
I see you're focused, yeah, you're so independent (so independent)
It's hard for me to open up, I'll admit it
You've got some shit to say and I'm here to listen

So baby, tell me where your love lies (lies)
Waste the day and spend the night (spend the night)
Underneath the sunrise
Show me where your love lies (show me where your love lies)
Tell me where your love lies
Waste the day and spend the night
Underneath the sunrise
Show me where your love lies

C. Louis :)
Tell me where your love is, you know
Cuz we got that magic girl you love it, yeah
Can’t keep my hands to myself in public (no)
You got me by my heart no I can’t function
Yeah, I just wanna keep it real
Yeah, I know you’re an independent woman
I just wanna know the deal
All in my feels 
And I know you’re head over heels
So show me where your love lies
While you lie down with me in your heels

If you're down, don't hide it
Feelin' me, you don't gotta deny it
Baby you gon' make me overnight it
Baby, are you down?
If you're down, don't hide it 
Feelin' me, you don't gotta deny it 
Baby you gon' make me overnight it
Baby, are you down? (Tell me where your love lies)

Tell me where your love lies
Waste the day and spend the night
Underneath the sunrise
Show me where your love lies

Tell me where your love lies
Waste the day and spend the night
Underneath the sunrise
Show me where your love lies

We personally love great vibes and love music so much. The story behind this song is up to how you feel & define “fallen angel” in your own way. We also wanted X to feature on this but God called him home unexpectedly. A fan made an edit of our song with X’s live video saying what he said, so we edited in this dance clip for everyone to focus on that mission we feel as well & we wanted everyone focus on that positivity. Once again this is for the culture, unity. Need to stop the violence and judging and love one another. 
#longlivex condolences to his family & friends.

Lyrics - 
said you wouldn't walk away
i know i make it hard to stay
The devil make it hard to pray
 Hit the climax Okay 
Burning holes 
Fallen Souls
Ice on my wrist so I stay cold 
Chosen for the fame 
I'll make sure you know my name 
Burning holes 
Fallen Souls
Ice on my wrist so I stay cold 
 im not chosen for the flames
fallen angels in my way x2
quit revealing your spell
Know this feeling too well x2 
I feel it I feel it I feel the devil watching me 
I hear it I hear it I hear the voices calling me 
I see it I see it I see that person stalking me 
These demons these demons  they starting to get onto me 
A lot of darkness need some light to it yeah yeah 
I tried to hide I tried fight all of these souls 
This fire inside trying to ignite baby yeah yeah 
I’m scared I don’t know where to go 
Fallen angels, fallen souls, fallen hopes, fallen goals 
I keep it real since day 1 I ain’t never gone fold 
Use to sleep on the floor, no heat in the cold 
Extra blankets kept us warm so I ain’t never letting go 
Stay deep and silent like a pack raccoons 
Like dirt on a carpet, I need a vacuum 
Chosen for the fame nobody asked you
Chosen for the fame nobody asked you
 im not chosen for the flames
fallen angels in my way x2
quit revealing your spell

Pictures,,2020-08-05T21:40:51Z,,,,,,,,,,"Watch the trailer for Judas and the Black Messiah, a movie about the betrayal and assassination of Fred Hampton, chairman of the Black Panther Party.  Starring Daniel Kaluuya and LaKeith Stanfield.  Only in theaters 2021.  “You can murder a revolutionary, but you can’t murder a revolution.""

https://www.facebook.com/WarnerBrosPictures/

Chairman Fred Hampton was 21 years old when he was assassinated by the FBI, who coerced a petty criminal named William O’Neal to help them silence him and the Black Panther Party.  But they could not kill Fred Hampton’s legacy and, 50 years later, his words still echo…louder than ever. 

I am a revolutionary!
         
In 1968, a young, charismatic activist named Fred Hampton became Chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party, who were fighting for freedom, the power to determine the destiny of the Black community, and an end to police brutality and the slaughter of Black people.

Chairman Fred was inspiring a generation to rise up and not back down to oppression, which put him directly in the line of fire of the government, the FBI and the Chicago Police.  But to destroy the revolution, they had to do it from both the outside…and the inside.  Facing prison, William O’Neal is offered a deal by the FBI: if he will infiltrate the Black Panthers and provide intel on Hampton, he will walk free.  O’Neal takes the deal.
         
Now a comrade in arms in the Black Panther Party, O’Neal lives in fear that his treachery will be discovered even as he rises in the ranks.  But as Hampton’s fiery message draws him in, O’Neal cannot escape the deadly trajectory of his ultimate betrayal.
         
Though his life was cut short, Fred Hampton’s impact has continued to reverberate.  The government saw the Black Panthers as a militant threat to the status quo and sold that lie to a frightened public in a time of growing civil unrest.  But the perception of the Panthers was not reality.  In inner cities across America, they were providing free breakfasts for children, legal services, medical clinics and research into sickle cell anemia, and political education.  And it was Chairman Fred in Chicago, who, recognizing the power of multicultural unity for a common cause, created the Rainbow Coalition—joining forces with other oppressed peoples in the city to fight for equality and political empowerment.

“Judas and the Black Messiah” stars Oscar nominee Daniel Kaluuya (“Get Out,” “Widows,” “Black Panther”) as Fred Hampton and LaKeith Stanfield (“Atlanta,” “The Girl in the Spider’s Web”) as William O’Neal.  The film also stars Jesse Plemons (“Vice,” “Game Night,” “The Post”), Dominique Fishback (“The Hate U Give,” “The Deuce”), Ashton Sanders (“The Equalizer 2,” “Moonlight”) and Martin Sheen (“The Departed,” TV’s “The West Wing,” TV’s “Grace & Frankie”).

“Judas and the Black Messiah” is directed by Shaka King, marking his studio feature film directorial debut.  The project originated with King and his writing partner, Will Berson, who co-wrote the screenplay, and Kenny Lucas & Keith Lucas, who co-wrote the story with Berson & King.  King, who has a long relationship with filmmaker Ryan Coogler (“Black Panther,” “Creed,” “Fruitvale Station”), pitched the film to Coogler and Charles D. King (“Just Mercy,” “Fences”), who are producing the film.  The executive producers are Sev Ohanian, Zinzi Coogler, Kim Roth, Poppy Hanks, Ravi Mehta, Jeff Skoll, Anikah McLaren, Aaron L. Gilbert, Jason Cloth, Ted Gidlow, and Niija Kuykendall.

The ensemble cast also includes Algee Smith (“The Hate U Give,” “Detroit”), Darrell Britt-Gibson (“Just Mercy,” “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri”), Dominique Thorne (“If Beale Street Could Talk”), Amari Cheatom (“Roman J. Israel, Esq.,” “Django Unchained”), Caleb Eberhardt (“The Post”), and Lil Rel Howery (“Get Out”).

The behind-the-scenes creative team includes director of photography Sean Bobbitt (“12 Years a Slave,” “Widows”), production designer Sam Lisenco (“Shades of Blue”), editor Kristan Sprague (“Random Acts of Flyness”) and costume designer Charlese Antoinette Jones (“Raising Dion”).

The film is a Warner Bros. Pictures presentation, in association with MACRO Films, Participant and BRON Creative, and will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures.",pFc6I0rgmgY

His unorthodox, yet simple approach, has wielded surprising results and just might be the solution for all racial discourse.

Daryl Davis graduated from Howard University with a degree in Jazz. As a pianist, vocalist, and guitarist, he performs nationally and internationally with The Daryl Davis Band. He has also worked with such notables as Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley’s Jordanaires, The Legendary Blues Band, and many others.

In 1983, A chance occurrence after one of his performances led him to befriend a member of the Ku Klux Klan. This eventually led Daryl to become the first black author to travel the country interviewing KKK leaders and members, all detailed in his book, Klan-Destine Relationships. Today, Daryl owns numerous Klan robes and hoods, given to him by active members who became his friends and renounced the organization.

Since his journey began, Davis has joined an all-white country band, attended KKK rallies, and accepted a “certificate of friendship” from the Traditionalist American Knights of the KKK. He’s even the godfather of former Klan Imperial Wizard Roger Kelly’s granddaughter.

Davis has received the Elliott-Black and MLK awards as well as numerous other local and national awards for his work in race relations, and is often sought by media outlets as a consultant on the KKK and race relations. He is also an actor with stage and screen credits, appearing in the critically acclaimed HBO police drama, The Wire, and most recently, as the subject of the documentary Accidental Courtesy, which filmed his real life encounters with Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi leaders as he helps to dismantle racism across the United States

--
Despite only working in the industry for 9 years, Adam Driver has an untouchably great AND diverse acting resume. His candor, passion, and humility on- and off-screen make him one of the best actors today (as approved by Scorsese, Spike Lee, Edgar Wright, Steven Soderbergh, Jar Jar Abrams, etc). With the end of the Star Wars sequel trilogy, his 2019 films, and awards season hype, I'm so happy that he's finally getting the love he deserves. 

All giggles and massive crushes towards such a talented, humble, and funny man are appreciated. Or use this as a form of self-care after watching Rise of Skywalker. Or Marriage Story. Or The Report. Or Cats, just because you're a brave soul and I hear you.

thanks for watching!

Film Synopsis: From visionary filmmaker Spike Lee comes the incredible true story of an American hero. In the early 1970s, Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) becomes the first African-American detective in the Colorado Springs Police Department. Determined to make a difference, he bravely sets out on a dangerous mission: infiltrate and expose the Ku Klux Klan. He recruits a seasoned colleague, Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver), into the undercover investigation. Together, they team up to take down the extremist organization aiming to garner mainstream appeal. Produced by the team behind the Academy Award®–winning Get Out, BlacKkKlansman offers an unflinching, true-life examination of race relations in 1970s America that is just as relevant in today's tumultuous world.

y09ettRnwH4,,BlacKkKlansman - First Meeting (4K UHD),FF Movie Clips,,2019-01-22T23:16:38Z,,,,,,,,,,"From the movie BlacKkKlansman (2018). 

Flip Zimmerman infiltrates the Colorado Springs chapter of the KKK while encountering tough questions from certain group members.

BlacKkKlansman is a 2018 American biographical crime film directed by Spike Lee and written by Charlie Wachtel, David Rabinowitz, Kevin Willmott, and Lee, based on the 2014 memoir Black Klansman by Ron Stallworth. The film stars John David Washington as Stallworth, along with Adam Driver, Laura Harrier, and Topher Grace. Set in 1970s Colorado Springs, the plot follows the first African-American detective in the city's police department as he sets out to infiltrate and expose the local chapter of the Ku Klux Klan. The film received acclaim from critics, who praised the performances (particularly of Washington and Driver) and timely themes, as well as noting it as a return to form for Lee. It received six nominations at the 91st Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director (Lee's first directing nomination), and Best Supporting Actor for Driver, and won for Best Adapted Screenplay, making it Lee's first non-honorary Academy Award. The American Film Institute also selected it as one of the top 10 films of the 2018, and at the 76th Golden Globe Awards it earned four nominations, including Best Motion Picture – Drama.",pFc6I0rgmgY

 또한, 타이틀곡 '울고 싶지 않아'는 세븐틴으로서는 본격적으로 처음 EDM을 시도한 곡으로 세븐틴이 그동안 보여준 소년의 순수한 감정을 유지하되, 보다 깊은 모습을 드러내며 깊은 감성을 보여주고자 노력한 곡이다. 또한, 서정적인 감성을 담고 있는 신디사이저와 격렬한 비트가 교차하면서 눈물이 흐를 것 같지만 울고 싶지 않은 세븐틴의 마음을 담아냈으며, 특히 슬픈 감성 사이로 듣는 사람의 귀를 사로잡는 비트가 매혹적인 곡이다.

세븐틴 7번째 미니 앨범 [헹가래]는 정규 3집 [An Ode]에서 마주했던 ‘두려움’의 감정에서 벗어나 ‘꿈’을 가지고 다시 한번 새로운 세상으로 함께 나아가자는 힘찬 에너지를 담았으며 꿈을 향해 도전하는 청춘에게 응원의 메시지를 전하는 앨범이다.

이번 앨범을 통해 세븐틴은 갈림길에 서서 고민하는 청춘들의 아픔을 표현하기보다는 세븐틴만의 발상으로 그들에게 먼저 손을 내밀며 응원하고, 열정적인 에너지로 스며들게 하며 명랑하고 톡톡 튀는 색다른 매력을 선보일 예정이다. 

세븐틴만의 색으로 담아낸 청춘들의 힐링 앨범 [헹가래]의 타이틀곡 ‘Left & Right’는 2000년대 힙합 장르를 고안하여 2020년의 사운드로 새롭게 재탄생 시킨 곡으로 왼쪽, 오른쪽 그 어디에도 출구가 없다고 느끼는 이들에게 긍정적으로 “두려움 없이 힘차게 나가자”라고 응원의 목소리를 외치며 파워풀한 에너지를 선사한다.

SEVENTEEN’s 7th Mini Album [Heng:garae], is an energetic album that breaks away from the emotion of fear, which was expressed through the 3rd Album [An Ode], and urges you to dream and run toward a new world together. The album aims to deliver a message of encouragement for the youth, as they work toward their dreams.

Rather than expressing the hardships of the youth facing a fork in the road, SEVENTEEN lends a hand of support in their own way by exuding a cheerful and unique charm with passionate energy.

[Heng:garae] is a healing album for the youth that illustrates the unique colors of SEVENTEEN. The title track ‘Left & Right,’ inspired by the hip-hop genre from the 2000’s, recreated a 2020 sound with powerful energy. The track encourages those who feel there is no escape whether they turn left or right, sending a message to stay positive and to “move forward boldly without fear.”

F9CrRG6j2SM,,[M/V] SEVENTEEN(세븐틴) - HIT,SEVENTEEN,,2019-08-05T08:11:51Z,,,,,,,,,,"13명의 뚜렷한 음악 색을 바탕으로 세븐틴 표 노래와 무대를 전 세계에 알리며 독보적인 독창성을 보여주고 있는 자체 제작 아이돌 세븐틴이 또 한 번의 이미지 변신과 함께 명곡 탄생을 예감케 하는 디지털 싱글 ‘HIT’로 대중들의 심장을 강타할 예정이다.

이번 디지털 싱글의 타이틀곡 ‘HIT’는 임팩트 있는 강렬한 EDM 장르의 댄스 곡으로 제목처럼 타격감이 느껴지는 사운드와 세븐틴의 폭발적인 에너지가 그대로 전해져 파워풀함의 끝을 보여주는 곡이다. 특히 모두가 주목할만한 역대급 퍼포먼스로 안무에 더욱 완성도를 높였으며 ‘우리를 구속하고 통제하는 것으로부터 벗어나자’는 해방을 외치며 저돌적으로 돌파구를 찾는 메시지를 담아내 가요계 또 다른 히트를 이끌 예정이다.

또한 이번 싱글은 세븐틴이 새로운 세계로의 확장을 꿈꾸며 보내는 찬가로 이전에는 찾아볼 수 없었던 한층 더 성숙해진 매력의 세븐틴을 만나 볼 수 있어 과연 그들이 쏘아 올린 신호탄이 이후 어떤 색다른 프로젝트로 녹여질지 세븐틴이 써 내려갈 이야기에 많은 호기심을 자극하고 있다.

“Self-producing idols,” SEVENTEEN, known for showing originality worldwide through their 13 distinct musical colors, return to the public with their digital single, ""HIT"". The group plans to steal the hearts of many through this future “hit” track.  

The digital single’s title track, “HIT,” is a dynamic EDM genre dance track. Like the title, the intense sound and SEVENTEEN’s explosive energy combine to create a powerful performance. The choreography is also brought to another level, seeking to capture the attention of many. As the lyrics ask for “liberation from those that oppress us,” SEVENTEEN plans to make this track another “hit” by expressing a message of freedom.

Also, this single expresses SEVENTEEN’s dream of expanding into a new world, showing a more mature side of the group. This single anticipates what kind of new projects are in store and many continue to look forward to the stories SEVENTEEN will tell through their future projects.

청량하면서도 동시에 파워풀한 모습으로 세븐틴의 변화와 성장을 압축적으로 보여주며, 아무리 힘들고 괴로운 일이 있어도 세븐틴, 그리고 세븐틴을 성원하는 팬들의 마음을 함께 해 뚫고 나가겠다는 다짐과 건강한 에너지를 담았다.

CNEeAaH3bFc,,[M/V] SEVENTEEN(세븐틴)-붐붐(BOOMBOOM),SEVENTEEN,,2016-12-04T14:57:09Z,,,,,,,,,,"세븐틴이 세 번째 미니앨범 Seventeen 3rd Mini Album ’Going Seventeen’을 발표, 찬란한 열정을 가지고 돌아온다.

타이틀곡 ‘붐붐’을 포함한 신곡 8곡으로 구성된 ’Going Seventeen’은 꿈을 향한 열정이라는 키워드를 가지고 ‘Make A Wish’, ‘Make It Happen’, ‘Make The Seventeen’의 총 세 개 버전으로 발매된다.

세 장의 앨범에서는 세븐틴이 배를 만들어 가는 과정을 통해 그들의 꿈과 열정이 담긴 결과물이 완성되고, 그것을 통해 새로운 세상으로 나아가는 모습을 담았다. 타이틀곡 ‘붐붐’은 이런 꿈과 열정을 통해 목표를 위해 달려갈 때의 설렘과 좋아하는 이성을 봤을 때의 쿵쾅거리는 마음을 ‘붐(BOOM)’이라는 단어를 통해 표현했다. 세븐틴의 열정 넘치는 에너지를 마음껏 느낄 수 있는 곡으로 반복되어 나오는 ‘붐’이 자연스럽게 뇌리에 박혀 쉽게 흥얼거릴 수 있고, 이전보다 더욱 힘찬 세븐틴의 에너지를 느낄 수 있다.

UB4FzllQCyc,,SEVENTEEN (세븐틴) 'HOME;RUN' Official MV,HYBE LABELS,,2020-10-19T07:58:12Z,,,,,,,,,,"SEVENTEEN (세븐틴) 'HOME;RUN' Official MV

세븐틴의 이번 앨범 ‘; [Semicolon]’은 미니 7집 ‘헹가래’를 통해 이야기한 ‘청춘’을 향한 응원의 메시지를 다시금 공유하면서 한 발짝 더 나아가 쉼 없이 달리는 청춘에게 ‘잠깐 쉬어가며 청춘의 향연을 즐기자’라는 더욱 성숙한 긍정의 메시지를 전하는 앨범이다.

현 시대를 살아가며 고군분투 하고 있는 청춘들에게 잠시나마 ‘숨 고를 시간’, ‘함께 웃으며 즐길 수 있는 시간’을 문장을 잠시 끊었다가 이어서 설명을 계속할 때 쓰이는 문장 부호인 ‘Semicolon(세미콜론)’ 에 비유, 동시대 청춘으로 살아가는 “세븐틴” 그들의 공감을 전하는 메시지를 앨범에 가득 담아내어 청춘들을 어루만질 따뜻한 위로와 응원, 공감을 주는 희망의 외침을 전한다.

타이틀곡 ‘HOME;RUN’은 스윙 장르 기반의 레트로한 사운드가 돋보이는 곡으로 경쾌하고 타격감 넘치는 사운드로 ‘HOME RUN’이라는 표현이 지닌 짜릿함을 표현하였고, 무한한 성장을 지닌 청춘에게 힘찬 응원과 위로의 목소리를 선사한다.

SEVENTEEN’s new album ‘; [Semicolon]’ is an album where they share the encouraging message for the ‘youth’ like they did in their 7th mini album ‘Heng:garæ’ and also the positive message that ‘we should all take a break and enjoy the youth’ with the youth that are running towards their goals without any breaks.

‘Semicolon,’ which is a punctuation mark used when you pause a sentence and then resume again, is used as a metaphor to portray the ‘time to take a breath’ and ‘time to laugh and enjoy together.’ “SEVENTEEN,” as the youth who are living in the same time period as the other youth who are fighting alone and struggling through their lives, uses this metaphor to convey their hopeful and empathic message through the album to comfort and cheer for the youth.

The title song ‘HOME;RUN’ is a song based on swing genre where the retro-like sound stands out, and it portrays the excitement that the phrase ‘HOME RUN’ conveys with cheerful and rhythmical sound. It conveys powerful support and comfort to the youth with limitless potentials.

특히 ‘역대급 청량美’를 예고한 세븐틴의 타이틀곡 ‘어쩌나’는 누군가를 좋아하는 감정을 무엇으로도 형용할 수 없을 만큼 너무 좋아서 ‘어쩌나’라는 말 밖에 나오지 않는 벅찬 마음과 함께 풋풋한 감정을 담아낸 곡으로, 세븐틴만 이 표현해내는 예쁜 가사와 경쾌한 스윙 리듬과 얼반 소울을 기반으로 한 멜로디가 함께 녹아 들어 한층 세련되고 청량한 분위기를 자아내 음악 팬들의 두 귀를 단숨에 사로잡을 예정이다.

SEVENTEEN released a new album 'YOU MAKE MY DAY' after 5 months, and it presents the most wonderful moment of SEVENTEEN's youth.

Especially, their title song ""Oh My!"" with 'the most refreshing vibe ever' means shouting ""Oh My!"", because no other words can explain the feeling of liking someone. It, indeed, delivers full heart emotion of young love and definitely catches the attention of every listener with sophisticated and fresh ambiance from SEVENTEEN's unique lyrics and melody like cheerful swing rhythm and Urban soul.

ap14O5-G7UA,,[M/V] SEVENTEEN(세븐틴) - 독 : Fear,SEVENTEEN,,2019-09-16T08:39:25Z,,,,,,,,,,"‘자체제작’ 타이틀로 가요계에서 꾸준히 성장세를 보이고 있는 세븐틴이 이번엔 정규 3집 [An Ode]로 더욱 성숙하고 깊이 있는 앨범으로 돌아왔다.

세븐틴의 정규 3집 [An Ode]는 'Ode(시)'를 통해 화자가 메시지를 은유적으로 표현하듯 세븐틴 또한 그들이 전하고 싶은 메시지를 다양한 방식으로 녹여내 특별한 의미를 전달, 많은 이야기를 담아냈다.

특히 누구나 한번쯤 느낄 수 있는 '두려움'을 세븐틴은 창작하는 과정을 통해 느끼는 감정 중 하나로 마주해 이에 대해 스스로 내면 깊숙이 통찰, 고뇌에 빠진 세븐틴을 한 단계 더 성장하게 했다.

또한 세븐틴의 대표 수식어인 ‘자체제작돌’에 걸맞게 이번 정규 3집 [An Ode]에서도 멤버들이 음악 작업에 참여해 진정성을 더하며 세븐틴만의 감성으로 한층 더 성숙해진 완성형 음악을 선사할 예정이다.

SEVENTEEN returns with their 3rd full length album, [An Ode], proving their growth and maturity as “self-producing” artists.
 
As a writer metaphorically expresses his/her message through an “ode,” SEVENTEEN also seeks to share their messages and stories to listeners through this album.

“Fear” is an emotion many people encounter at least once in their lifetime. SEVENTEEN explores fear as an emotion they face during their creative process. As the members search within for insight, the agony they endure help them develop one step further as artists.

As expected from “self-producing idols,” the members participated in producing the album, adding on to the authenticity of their music. Through [An Ode], SEVENTEEN plans to present their distinct emotions in a more sophisticated manner.

‘어둠 속에 있던 나에게 새벽을 만들어 준 너’라는 의미를 담은 세븐틴의 미니 6집 ‘YOU MADE MY DAWN’은 전작 미니 5집 ‘YOU MAKE MY DAY’가 가지고 있던 서사를 완성하는 앨범으로 전반적으로 멤버들이 작사, 작곡에 참여하며 진정성 있는 음악을 선보이는 것은 물론 탄탄하고 보다 깊이감 있는 앨범으로 탄생시켜냈으며 과감히 변화한 모습과 함께 그들의 무서운 성장세를 보여주고 있다. 

타이틀곡 ‘Home’은 어둠 속을 밝혀주고 기분 좋은 낮을 선사했던 너에게 편안함을 느끼게 해주고 싶은 마음을 담아냈으며 좋아하는 상대에 대한 소중함을 애틋한 감성으로 표현, 서로가 서로에게 기댈 수 있는 존재로서 어떤 어려움이라도 이겨내려는 마음을 ‘집’에 비유해 풀어내어 따뜻한 가사와 섬세한 감정선으로 리스너들을 편안하게 만든다.

“You made my darkness into dawn.” This message behind Seventeen’s 6th Mini Album, ‘YOU MADE MY DAWN,’ completes the narrative from the previous 5th Mini Album, ‘YOU MAKE MY DAY.’ The members of Seventeen contributed to the entire album by taking part in both composing and writing the lyrics, adding on to their genuine style and creating a stronger and deeper album. The artists continue to display their maturity by exploring different genres and styles of music.

The title track, “Home,” expresses the desire to present comfort to a loved one who has brightened the day when one was still in darkness. The emotional lyrics compare “home” to the mutual feelings of loved ones and how any obstacle can be conquered by relying on each other. The warm lyrics and delicate emotions expressed through the track looks to comfort the listeners.

Lyrics

I broke my bones
Playing games with you
This type of fun
That makes me blue

Oh, I
I think I'm into you
How much do you want it too?
What are you prepared to do?
I think I'm gonna make it worse
I talk to you, but it don't work
I touch you, but it starts to hurt
What have I been doing wrong?
Tell me what it is you want
Tell me what it is you want
Tell me what it is you

Oh, I think that if I had been enough for you
Would I be better, would I be good?
And I'll do what you like if you'll stay the night
You tell me you don't think you should
You do it, boy
Well, love, I will let you go
Love, I will let you go
Love, I will let you go
Love, I will let you go
Ooh, it's enough to be better, if I could

I itch all night
I itch for you
You're just my type
What's a boy to do?

Oh, I
I think I'm into you
How much do you want it too?
What are you prepared to do?
I think I'm gonna make it worse
I talk to you, but it don't work
I touch you, but it starts to hurt
What have I been doing wrong?
Tell me what it is you want
Tell me what it is you want
Tell me what it is you

Oh, I think that if I had been enough for you
Would I be better, would I be good?
And I'll do what you like if you'll stay the night
You tell me you don't think you should
You do it, boy
Well, love, I will let you go
Love, I will let you go
Love, I will let you go
Love, I will let you go
Ooh, it's enough to be better, if I could

Yeah, if I had been enough for you
Would I be better, would I be good?
And I'll do what you like if you'll stay the night
You tell me you don't think you should
I think you should
Oh, love, I will let you go
Love, I will let you go
Love, I will let you go
Love, I will let you go
Oh, it's enough to be better, if I could

Love, I will let you go
Love, I will let you go
Love, I will let you go

Lyrics:

When I look back upon my life
it’s always with a sense of shame
I’ve always been the one to blame
For everything I long to do
no matter when or where or who
has one thing in common too

It’s a, it’s a, it’s a, it’s a sin
It’s a sin
Everything I’ve ever done
Everything I ever do
Every place I’ve ever been
Everywhere I’m going to
It’s a sin

At school they taught me how to be
so pure in thought and word and deed
They didn’t quite succeed
For everything I long to do
no matter when or where or who
has one thing in common too

It’s a, it’s a, it’s a, it’s a sin
It’s a sin
Everything I’ve ever done
Everything I ever do
Every place I’ve ever been
Everywhere I’m going to
It’s a sin

Father forgive me
I tried not to do it
Turned over a new leaf
then tore right through it
Whatever you taught me
I didn’t believe it
Father you fought me
‘cause I didn’t care
and I still don’t understand

So I look back upon my life
forever with a sense of shame
I’ve always been the one to blame
For everything I long to do
no matter when or where or who
has one thing in common too

It’s a, it’s a, it’s a, it’s a sin
It’s a sin
Everything I’ve ever done
Everything I ever do
Every place I’ve ever been
Everywhere I’m going to I
It’s a sin

Confiteor Deo omnipotenti vobis
fratres quia peccavi nimis cogitatione, verbo, opere
et omissione. Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa.

Lyrics

I...
I'm waking spirits tonight
And I can hear your voice
I got nothing to hide
'Cause you're with another boy
And I'm carving the sky
I'm having visions
Manifesting us in time
So I ride from the coast
I've got three more days
I know you want me the most
Want me in an altered state
I've been sleeping with ghosts
And I swallow medication
You should know

Strike a match and whisper my name
(Burning, burning)
Speak in tongues
Bend me 'til I break
(Burning, burning)

And I'm giving in to your fever touch
Let it all begin when the fire starts
You're the darkness in me, Palo Santo
And the memories are filling up with smoke
You remember me and I start to choke
You're the darkness in me, Palo Santo, oh
(Burning, burning)

Does the mark on my skin make you hot with shame?
'Cause I'm in love with the sin
And I know how to take the blame (know how to take the blame)
And I'll let you in
Do I look good in this position, just like him?
Ooh

Strike a match and whisper my name
(Burning, burning)
Speak in tongues
Bend me 'til I break
(Burning, burning)

And I'm giving in to your fever touch (fever)
Let it all begin when the fire starts
You're the darkness in me, Palo Santo
And the memories are filling up with smoke
You remember me and I start to choke
You're the darkness in me, Palo Santo, oh
(Burning, burning)

I want, I want, I want all the danger
Come on, come on, come on
Keep me craving
This sweet intoxication, it shakes my soul
I want, I want, I want entertainment
Come on, come on, come on
Keep me craving
This sweet intoxication, it shakes my soul (my soul)

And I'm giving in to your fever touch
Let it all begin when the fire starts
You're the darkness in me, Palo Santo (Palo Santo)
And the memories are filling up with smoke
You remember me and I start to choke
You're the darkness in me, Palo Santo

You're, you're the darkness
You're, you're the darkness
You are the darkness in me, Palo Santo
Oh
You're, you're the darkness (you are, you are)
You're, you're the darkness (you are)
You are the darkness in me, Palo Santo

Lyrics:

Talk me that shit I like it soulful
Give me that fresh opinion
We'll keep it innovating 
I like the way I get to know you
Feel all your human nature
Can't see a day without ya

Cause you be sexy how you reading my mind
I want you all the time
And this is so new
You showed me colours I would never have seen
You're changing what I believe
But this is so true

Naked and falling in love
Look here I got you
Safe where there's no one to judge
Keep it insightful

Oh you got me shook
I'm falling I can't, I'm falling I cannot believe it
Touched with one look
I'm crawling and my, I'm crawling and my hearts conceding
What could I do
But follow your love
Cause I don't wanna fight the feeling
You got me shook
I'm falling & I, I'm falling & I got to preach it

Faithful to learning more about you
Keep it 100 with ya
Hope that you make me better
Ain't got no pressure this is so cool
Love that we vibe together
Love that we so off-centre

Maybe we'll fuck up sometimes
But who the fuck cares
I want your faults your errors
Fuck all those insta scammers
You showed me textures I would never have seen
You've gone and made me believe
Damn this is no dream

Naked and falling in love
Look here I got you
Safe where there's no one to judge
Keep it insightful

Oh you got me shook
I'm falling I can't, I'm falling I cannot believe it
Touched with one look
I'm crawling and my, I'm crawling and my hearts conceding
What could I do
But follow your love
Cause I don't wanna fight the feeling
You got me shook
I'm falling & I, I'm falling & I got to preach it

Yes in the past I was lost,
But you got me praying
You got me saying oh lord
I see the heaven in us
Make me a believer
I can feel the rush for ya
It's taking control of my body
No point denying all of this magic in here
And I can see us, I can see trust
I can see love without fear",niviooakBLs

It's A Sin (Lyrics) 
When I look back upon my life
It's always with a sense of shame
I've always been the one to blame
For everything I long to do
No matter when or where or who
Has one thing in common, too

It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
It's a sin
Everything I've ever done
Everything I ever do
Every place I've ever been
Everywhere I'm going to
It's a sin

At school they taught me how to be
So pure in thought and word and deed
They didn't quite succeed
For everything I long to do
No matter when or where or who
Has one thing in common, too

It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
It's a sin
Everything I've ever done
Everything I ever do
Every place I've ever been
Everywhere I'm going to
It's a sin

So I look back upon my life
Forever with a sense of shame
I've always been the one to blame
For everything I long to do
No matter when or where or who
Has one thing in common, too

It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
It's a sin
Everything I've ever done
Everything I ever do
Every place I've ever been
Everywhere I'm going to
It's a sin",niviooakBLs

When the It's A Sin star joined Capital Breakfast with Roman Kemp, Olly explained why they decided to make this move.

""Me, Mikey and Emre met, like, ten years ago,"" said the 'Starstruck' singer. ""We've been in this band for a decade, and in that time, we've just kind of grown apart musically.""

Starstruck (Lyrics)
 
I can’t help it
I get starstruck around you
 
I feel like all these people in this room
Don’t shine like you
If I could bottle you up
I would sip ya
Like cosmic juice
 
So give me that good love
Good love all night
Don’t need your cash
I got my own to spend it on ya
If I like
If you wanna dance baby let’s dance
We can dream until the sun rise
 
I can’t help it
I get starstruck around you
What can I do, baby
I can’t help it
I get starstruck around you
What can I do
 
There ain’t no reason why
I can’t speak, think or stop
Staring at your glow
I wanna tell you everything that’s on my mind baby
Even if I choke, ooh yeah
 
So give me that good love
Good love all night
Don’t need your cash
I got my own to spend it on ya
If I like
If you wanna dance baby let’s dance
We can dream until the sun rise
 
I can’t help it
I get starstruck around you
What can I do, baby
I can’t help it
I get starstruck around you
What can I do
When I get my hands on you
 
I’m not giving, not giving you up
I’m not giving, not giving you up
I’m not giving, not giving you up
I’m not giving, not giving you up up up, no
 
I can’t help it
I get starstruck around you
What can I do, baby
 
Starstruck, not giving you up
Starstruck, not giving you up
 
I can’t help it
I get starstruck around you
What can I do, baby
I can’t help it
I get starstruck around you
What can I do
(Oh what can I do)
 
I’m not giving, not giving you up
I’m not giving, not giving you up
I’m not giving, not giving you up
I’m not giving, not giving you up up up, no
 
I can’t help it
I get starstruck around you
What can I do

Kif l-istorja ġiet magħluqa
U l-istorbju mtela skiet  
Bħal l-għajta ta’ tarbija  
Li l-ħajja donnha bdiet  
Ser tarani għal dak li jien?  

Id f’id mal-ħmura ta’ kull filgħodu 
Inħares f’għajnejk u jdejja jirtogħdu  
Nimxu l-mogħdija fejn ninsew kull uġigħ  

Ser inkun qed nistenniek 
Kull sekonda naraha ġurnata  
Indur ma nafx x’ser insib 
Ħares dritt f’għajnejja 
Ħsibt f’dil-melodija  
U ktibtha bi tbissima  
Fir-rima ser insemmik 
Ħa tkun taf kemm sirt naħseb fik x2 
Ħa tkun taf kemm sirt naħseb   

Jekk nimxu b’passi bħal tal-iljun  
Int l-ilma ġieri u jien il-vapur 
M’hemmx ħin mitluf  
Bik nagħlaq it-truf  
Ser ngħix, ħa nixgħel u mmut 
Mad-dija  
Xħin negħlbu l-mistħija  
Hawn mimli mħabba u tbatija  
Ċans wieħed biss illejla   

Ser inkun qed nistenniek 
Kull sekonda naraha ġurnata  
Indur ma nafx x’ser insib 
Ħares dritt f’għajnejja 
Ħsibt f’dil-melodija  
U ktibtha bi tbissima  
Fir-rima ser insemmik 
Ħa tkun taf kemm sirt naħseb fik x2 
Ħa tkun taf kemm sirt naħseb 

U mal-ħmura ta’ kull filgħaxija  
Ħarist lejk u għaddiet żiffa fina  
Hawn ser inkun 
Nistenniek
Naħseb Fik  

Ser inkun qed nistenniek 
Kull sekonda naraha ġurnata  
Indur ma nafx x’ser insib

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Sometimes I just can't take it
Sometimes I just can't take it
And it isn't alright
I'm not going to make it
And I think my shoe is untied
I'm like a broken record
I'm like a broken record
And I'm not playing right
Just wanna go up higher, can we?
Till you tell me I'm a heavenly photo

[Pre Chorus]
Hold tight (hold tight)
Come on (come on)
Come on (come on)
Woah
Come on (come on)
Come on (come on)
Don't let go
Hold tight (hold tight)
Hold tight (hold tight)
Woah
It's alright, it's alright
You said
Woah
It's alright, it's alright
You said
I've got my hands up, shaking just to let you know

[Chorus]
That you've got a higher power
Got me singing every second
Dancing every hour
Oh, yeah
You'vе got a higher power
And you're rеally someone
I want to know
Oh!

[Verse 2]
This boy is electric (ooh)
This boy is electric and you're sparkling like
The universe connected
And I'm buzzing
Night after night after night
This joy is electric
This joy is electric and you're circuiting through
I'm so happy that I'm alive
Happy I'm alive at the same time as you

[Chorus]
'Cause you've got a higher power
Got me singing every second
Dancing every hour
Oh, yeah
You've got a higher power
And you're really someone
I want to know
Oh!
(I wanna know, oh!)

[Bridge]
You've got
Yeah you've got a higher
You've got
Yeah you've got a higher
You've got
Yeah you've got a higher
You've got
Oh
You've got
Oh you've got a higher
You've got
Yeah you've got a higher
You've got
Oh you've got a higher
My hands up, shaking just to let you know that

[Chorus]
You've got a higher power
Got me singing every second
Dancing every hour
Oh, yeah
You've got a higher power

[Outro]
Once in a lifetime
I'm going a million miles an hour
And for so long
I've been down on my knees
To your love song
Floats me over and over
For so long
I've been down on my knees
To your love song
Floats me oh
Oh

Big or small, spending time honing your craft and performing in venues is vital on the journey to becoming a successful touring and recording artist. We must never live in a world where live music venues don’t exist. They are as important for the artist as they are for the countless visitors and of course the dedicated staff that devote themselves to running those rooms like clockwork. Venues offer a joy, an escape and a magic you just don’t experience through a screen or even through a stereo speaker. At all costs, we must save our venues.

“New Light”

I’m the boy in your other phone
Lighting up inside your drawer at home all alone
Pushin 40 in the friend zone
We talk and then you walk away every day
Oh you don’t think twice bout me
And maybe you’re right to doubt me but
But if you give me just one night
You’re gonna see me in a new light
Yeah if you give me just one night
To meet you underneath the moonlight

Oh I want a take two
I wanna break through
I wanna know the real thing about you
So I can see you in a new light

Take a ride up to Malibu
I just wanna sit and look at you, look at you
What would it matter if your friends knew
Who cares what other people say anyway
Oh we can go far from here
And make a new world together babe

‘Cause if you give me just one night
You’re gonna see me in a new light
Yeah, if you give me just one night
To meet you underneath the moonlight

Oh I want a take two
I wanna break through
I wanna know the real thing about you
So I can see you in a new light

Yeah if you give me just one night
You’re gonna see me in a new light
Yeah if you give me just one night
To meet you underneath the moonlight

What do I do with all this, what do I do with all this
Love that's runnin through my veins for you
What do I do with all this, what do I do with all this
Love that's runnin through my veins for you
What do I do with all this, what do I do with all this

His incredible catalogue includes the studio albums ‘+’ (plus), ‘x’ (multiply) and ‘÷’ (divide) which spawned hit singles such as ‘The A team’ , ’Lego House’, ‘Sing', ‘Thinking Out Loud’, ‘Photograph’, ‘Shape Of You’, ‘Castle on The Hill’ and ‘Perfect’. 
 
In 2019, Ed Sheeran released the genre-spanning ‘No.6 Collaborations Project’ which featured a wide-range of artists including ‘Justin Bieber’, ‘Camilla’ Cabello’, ‘Travis Scott’, ‘Eminem’, ‘Cardi B, ‘Paulo Londra’, ‘Bruno Mars’ and ‘Stormzy’ amongst many others, producing hits such as ‘I Don’t Care’, ‘Beautiful People’, ‘South of The Border’ and ‘Take Me Back To London’.

I’m feeling younger, every time that I’m alone with you 
We were sitting in a parked car, stealing kisses in the front yard
We got questions we should not ask but

How would you feel, if I told you I loved you?
It’s just something that I want to do 
I’ll be taking my time, spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too

In the summer, as the lilacs bloom
Love flows deeper than the river, every moment that I spend with you 
We were sat upon our best friend’s roof, I had both of my arms round you 
Watching the sunrise replace the moon 

How would you feel, if I told you I loved you?
It’s just something that I want to do 
I’ll be taking my time spending my life 
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too

We were sitting in a parked car, stealing kisses in the front yard
We got questions we should not ask but

How would you feel, if I told you I loved you?
It’s just something that I want to do 
I’ll be taking my time, spending my life, 
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too

About Ed Sheeran: 
Ed Sheeran may be the quintessential pop star of the 2010s: an internationally acclaimed, multi-award winning singer/songwriter who seems to acknowledge no boundaries between styles or eras with elements of folk, hip-hop, pop, dance, soul, and rock woven throughout his music. 

His incredible catalogue includes the studio albums ‘+’ (plus), ‘x’ (multiply) and ‘÷’ (divide) which spawned hit singles such as ‘The A team’ , ’Lego House’, ‘Sing', ‘Thinking Out Loud’, ‘Photograph’, ‘Shape Of You’, ‘Castle on The Hill’ and ‘Perfect’. 
 
In 2019, Ed Sheeran released the genre-spanning ‘No.6 Collaborations Project’ which featured a wide-range of artists including ‘Justin Bieber’, ‘Camilla’ Cabello’, ‘Travis Scott’, ‘Eminem’, ‘Cardi B, ‘Paulo Londra’, ‘Bruno Mars’ and ‘Stormzy’ amongst many others, producing hits such as ‘I Don’t Care’, ‘Beautiful People’, ‘South of The Border’ and ‘Take Me Back To London’.

First up is James Bay, who kicks off his set with “Scars,” from his 2015 LP, Chaos and the Calm. Bay tells the camera that the track is about “realizing when you’ve lost something or someone, [and] that person or thing was so vital to you,” he says, “that you can’t make that mistake again.”

We've kept close tabs on James Bay's career for a few years now ever since he first popped into our Guildford store to buy a Gibson acoustic. Since then old Andertons staff member Jack Duxbury joined James' band on keys, and and James began using Victory Amps live so naturally Lee was super psyched to catch up with James for a very special Captain Meets to catch up with the man himself and talk all things guitars!

Lyrics:
Even in the darkest hour
You don't have to search so hard
You’re the one that holds the power
Now’s the time to play your part
 
If you could see your true colours
You wouldn’t have to try so hard
Hiding under all these covers
We all work the way we are

It’s the same with me and you and everybody
All hold tight our breath while waiting for the party

So many doors
So many closed to us
Oh baby my heart's open
You know that I stay open

Lost in the night
Standing outside the club
Oh baby my heart's open
You know that I stay open for you

Baby I can read the stars
And I see how they shine for you
Don't cave yourself up in the darkness
So many better things to do

Wish you could see your true colours
Don’t be afraid to play your cards
The sky is open you should follow
We all work the way we are

It’s the same with me and you and everybody
All hold tight our breath while waiting for the party

So many doors
So many closed to us
Oh baby my heart's open
You know that I stay open

Lost in the night
Standing outside the club
Oh baby my heart's open
You know that I stay open for you

It’s the same with me and you and everybody
All hold tight our breath while waiting for the party

It’s the same with me and you and everybody
All hold tight our breath while waiting for the party
So many doors
So many closed to us
Oh baby my heart's open
You know that I stay open
Lost in the night
Standing outside the club
Oh baby my heart's open
You know that I stay open for you

Lyrics:

From the hot strobe lights and the spiked punch bliss
And the long walks home in the dark we'll miss
Nobody teaches you how to reminisce
Nobody teaches you to hurt like this

Then we slide into the arms of someone else
Yeah, we slide into the arms of someone else

No more coked up, broke, nocturnal kids
Was that ever even us? Do we know what we missed?
Nobody teaches you how to win big
Nobody said there's no reverse on this

Then we slide into the arms of someone else
Yeah, we slide into the arms of someone else
In disguise, we get a little better at controlling ourselves around midnight
Then we slide into the arms of someone else

Nobody wants to, nobody wants to
Nobody wants to, nobody wants to
Nobody wants to wake up alone

Then we slide into the arms of someone else
Then we slide into the arms of someone else
In disguise, we get a little better at controlling ourselves around midnight
But then we slide into the arms of some, someone else

The weight of the world is love
Under the burden of solitude, under the burden of dissatisfaction the weight
The weight we carry is love
And so must rest in the arms of love at last, must rest in the arms of love

Ħares dritt f’għajnejja

Ħa tkun taf kemm sirt naħseb fik x2 
Ħa tkun taf kemm sirt naħseb   

Jekk nimxu b’passi bħal tal-iljun  
Int l-ilma ġieri u jien il-vapur 
M’hemmx ħin mitluf  
Bik nagħlaq it-truf  
Ser ngħix, ħa nixgħel u mmut 
Mad-dija  
Xħin negħlbu l-mistħija  
Hawn mimli mħabba u tbatija  
Ċans wieħed biss illejla

kNcV9Gy5lQc,,Live Monterey Bay Cam - Monterey Bay Aquarium,Monterey Bay Aquarium,,2020-07-27T16:59:11Z,,,,,,,,,,"Our Monterey Bay cam offers a peek from the Aquarium's ocean-view decks.

From this vantage point, you can identify a number of the birds and sea mammals that find refuge here. Look for black cormorants perched on a rock, perhaps stretching their wings to dry. Watch the water's surface; you might see a harbor seal poke its head out of the water, or a sea otter wrapped in kelp.

Monterey Bay is part of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, a federally protected marine area offshore of California's central coast. This safe haven is home to a rich variety of fishes, plants, marine mammals and birds.

gz-SCxj8rds,,🦋THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT ⁂ Elevate your Vibration ⁂ Positive Aura Cleanse ⁂ 432Hz Music,Meditative Mind,,2019-08-23T23:23:19Z,,,,,,,,,,"THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT ⁂ Elevate your Vibration ⁂ Positive Aura Cleanse ⁂ 432Hz Music

Today's video is inspired by a beautiful concept called the Butterfly Effect. It’s the idea that even the smallest of our actions can cause ripples in the world, altering the course of events. Did you know that a tornado in the US can be influenced by seemingly minor thing such as the flapping of the wings of distant butterflies in Africa? 

Similarly, our small act of kindness, a simple smile, and those positive vibrations that we send out can have an exponential effect somewhere else, we may never witness. But these seemingly unimportant things and gestures are like the butterfly effect. 

Hope this video will help you in your meditation practice and have some butterfly effect somewhere.

Blessings and Peace All The Way
Much Gratitude.

About Jurassic World: 
From Universal Pictures and Amblin Entertainment, Jurassic World immerses audiences of all ages in a new era of wonder and thrills where dinosaurs and humankind must learn to coexist. Jurassic World is set against a global backdrop of diverse locations, with a sprawling story grounded in believable science and populated by distinctive dinosaurs, heroic humans, and cunning villains at both ends of the evolutionary spectrum.

Cinema's only dinosaur-driven live action franchise, Jurassic World has earned three Academy Awards® and over $3.6 billion worldwide across four films. Its cross- generational appeal can be attributed to audiences' enduring fascination with dinosaurs and boundless imagination, both nurtured by each new installment. Jurassic World is more than a film franchise. It is a larger-than-life destination for exploration, discovery, and epic adventure. Dinosaurs live again, and they live in Jurassic World.

_MwCMo7t3ps,,20 Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom Easter Eggs You Totally Missed,Screen Rant,,2018-07-04T03:23:37Z,,,,,,,,,,"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is packed with Easter Eggs and hidden details most viewers probably missed! Subscribe to our channel: http://goo.gl/ho3Hg6

Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom was filled with thrilling moments, huge plot twists, and the introduction to a new dinosaur known as the Indoraptor. Even with all the new content, the film was certainly filled with a lot of references and moments to other Jurassic Park movies and pop-culture together. Now it’s time to recap them all and see some of the tiniest details you may have missed!

The brachiosaurus had a huge return to the movie this time around, delivering a couple of key scenes, including one of the saddest scenes in the whole film. Direct references were made to the original Jurassic Park film in the form of flipped over Jeeps, the appearance of the T-Rex, and other small details. The original Jurassic World was not forgotten either as references were made to some key shots and moments well beyond the familiar gyrosphere scene. Once everyone was off the island, the Easter Eggs continued to appear on Lockwood’s giant estate. All of the references were directly connected with the big reveal of the Indoraptor and the traits she shared with raptors from past Jurassic Park movies. Dinosaurs weren’t the only thing referenced either as a goat made an appearance and then was reference in a key death from the movie. There is even a reference to The Lost World: Jurassic Park in the form of Blue’s scene after she was shot was on the island. Watch to see all of these Easter Eggs and moments you totally missed in the movie!

Probably should have ""spared no expense"" on the research budget. From the velociraptors' size, to the T-Rex's vision, to the lifting strength of pteranodons, the Jurassic Park franchise definitely prioritizes science fiction over science fact.
